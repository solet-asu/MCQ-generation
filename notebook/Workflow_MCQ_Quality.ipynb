    "You are an expert educational assessment specialist. Your task is to shorten MCQ options while preserving meaning and following syntactic rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "APPROACH:\n",
    "1. Analyze the original option's core meaning\n",
    "2. Identify unnecessary words and redundant phrases  \n",
    "3. Apply the syntactic rule exactly\n",
    "4. Generate candidates within the target word range\n",
    "5. Preserve all essential information\n",
    "\n",
    "GOOD EXAMPLES:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Original: \"The text examines various cultural concepts, such as material and nonmaterial culture, cultural universals, and attitudes towards other cultures, to understand how human behavior is learned and varies among cultures.\"\n",
    "Rule: \"The text + [verb] + [object/complement]\"\n",
    "Good shortened: \"The text examines cultural concepts explaining how human behavior is learned and varies across cultures.\"\n",

    "Example 2:\n",
    "Original: \"They permit elected officials to comprehend the preferences and needs of citizens.\"\n",
    "Rule: \"They + [verb] + [object/complement]\"  \n",
    "Good shortened: \"They permit elected officials to understand citizens' needs, preferences.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "BAD EXAMPLE to avoid:\n",
    "Original: \"It serves to establish and ensure guarantees of civil liberties.\"\n",
    "Bad shortened: \"ensuring and protecting civil liberties.\"\n",
    "Why bad: Changed syntactic structure completely, didn't follow the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "- Generate exactly 5 different shortened versions\n",
