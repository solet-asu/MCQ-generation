You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nAt the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nLocate the major West African empires on a map\\nDiscuss the roles of Islam and Europe in the slave trade\\nIt is difficult to generalize about West Africa, which was linked to the rise and diffusion of Islam. This geographical unit, central to the rise of the Atlantic World, stretches from modern-day Mauritania to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and encompasses lush rainforests along the equator, savannas on either side of the forest, and much drier land to the north. Until about 600 CE, most Africans were hunter-gatherers. Where water was too scarce for farming, herders maintained sheep, goats, cattle, or camels. In the more heavily wooded area near the equator, farmers raised yams, palm products, or plantains. The savanna areas yielded rice, millet, and sorghum. Sub-Saharan Africans had little experience in maritime matters. Most of the population lived away from the coast, which is connected to the interior by five main rivers—the Senegal, Gambia, Niger, Volta, and Congo.\\n Although there were large trading centers along these rivers, most West Africans lived in small villages and identified with their extended family or their clan. Wives, children, and dependents (including enslaved people) were a sign of wealth among men, and polygyny, the practice of having more than one wife at a time, was widespread. In time of need, relatives, however far away, were counted upon to assist in supplying food or security. Because of the clannish nature of African society, “we” was associated with the village and family members, while “they” included everyone else. Hundreds of separate dialects emerged; in modern Nigeria, nearly five hundred are still spoken.\\nCLICK AND EXPLORE\\nRead The Role of Islam in African Slavery to learn more about the African slave trade.\\n THE MAJOR AFRICAN EMPIRES\\nFollowing the death of the prophet Muhammad in 632 CE, Islam continued to spread quickly across North Africa, bringing not only a unifying faith but a political and legal structure as well. As lands fell under the control of Muslim armies, they instituted Islamic rule and legal structures as local chieftains converted, usually under penalty of death. Only those who had converted to Islam could rule or be engaged in trade. The first major empire to emerge in West Africa was the Ghana Empire (Figure 1.16). By 750, the Soninke farmers of the sub-Sahara had become wealthy by taxing the trade that passed through their area. For instance, the Niger River basin supplied gold to the Berber and Arab traders from west of the Nile Valley, who brought cloth, weapons, and manufactured goods into the interior. Huge Saharan salt mines supplied the life-sustaining mineral to the Mediterranean coast of Africa and inland areas. By 900, the monotheistic Muslims controlled most of this trade and had converted many of the African ruling elite. The majority of the population, however, maintained their tribal animistic practices, which gave living attributes to nonliving objects such as mountains, rivers, and wind.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Because Ghana’s king controlled the gold supply, he was able to maintain price controls and afford a strong military. Soon, however, a new kingdom emerged.\\n A map shows the locations of the major West African empires before 1492, including the Ghana Empire; Mali Empire; Kanem Empire; Yoruba Empire; Benin Empire; Songhay Empire; Bachwezi Empire; Great Zimbabwe Empire; Carthaginian Empire; Persian Achaemenid Empire; Fatimid Caliphate; and Umayyad Caliphate.\\n Figure 1.16 This map shows the general locations of major West African empires before 1492. Along the Mediterranean coast, Muslim states prevailed.\\n By 1200 CE, under the leadership of Sundiata Keita, Mali had replaced Ghana as the leading state in West Africa. After Sundiata’s rule, the court converted to Islam, and Muslim scribes played a large part in administration and government. Miners then discovered huge new deposits of gold east of the Niger River. By the fourteenth century, the empire was so wealthy that while on a hajj, or pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, Mali’s ruler Mansu Musa gave away enough gold to create serious price inflation in the cities along his route. Timbuktu, the capital city, became a leading Islamic center for education, commerce and the slave trade. Meanwhile, in the east, the city of Gao became increasingly strong under the leadership of Sonni Ali and soon eclipsed Mali’s power. Timbuktu sought Ali’s assistance in repelling the Tuaregs from the north. By 1500, however, the Tuareg empire of Songhay had eclipsed Mali, where weak and ineffective leadership prevailed.\\n THE ROLE OF SLAVERY\\nThe institution of slavery is not a recent phenomenon. Most civilizations have practiced some form of human bondage and servitude, and African empires were no different (Figure 1.17). Famine or fear of stronger enemies might force one tribe to ask another for help and give themselves in a type of bondage in exchange. Similar to the European serf system, those seeking protection, or relief from starvation, would become the servants of those who provided relief. Debt might also be worked off through a form of servitude. Typically, these servants became a part of the extended tribal family. There is some evidence of chattel slavery, in which people are treated as personal property to be bought and sold, in the Nile Valley. It appears there was a slave-trade route through the Sahara that brought sub-Saharan Africans to Rome, which had enslaved people from all over the world.\\n An illustration shows traders transporting a group of enslaved people, who are connected at the neck and bound at the wrists.\\n Figure 1.17 Traders with a group of enslaved people connected at the neck. Muslim traders brought enslaved people to the North African coast, where they might be sent to Europe or other parts of Africa.\\n Arab slave trading, which exchanged enslaved people for goods from the Mediterranean, existed long before Islam’s spread across North Africa. Muslims later expanded this trade and enslaved not only Africans but also Europeans, especially from Spain, Sicily, and Italy. Male captives were forced to build coastal fortifications and serve as enslaved galley people.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Women were added to the harem.\\n The major European slave trade began with Portugal’s exploration of the west coast of Africa in search of a trade route to the East. By 1444, enslaved people were being brought from Africa to work on the sugar plantations of the Madeira Islands, off the coast of modern Morocco. The slave trade then expanded greatly as European colonies in the New World demanded an ever-increasing number of workers for the extensive plantations growing tobacco, sugar, and eventually rice and cotton (Figure 1.18).\\n A map shows the routes that were used in the course of the slave trade and the number of enslaved people who traveled each route. Around 8,000,000 enslaved people were taken from West Central Africa to Brazil.   Around 4,000,000 enslaved people were taken from West Central Africa to Barbados in the Caribbean, and from there to the United States, Veracruz in present day Mexico, and other islands in the Caribbean. Around 2,000,000 enslaved people were taken from the Swahili Coast in East Africa to Arabia and the Persian Gulf. From places in West Africa such as the Gold Coast, Bight of Benin, and Bight of Biafra, around 1,000,000 enslaved people were taken to Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt, all in Northern Africa.\\n Figure 1.18 This map shows the routes that were used in the course of the slave trade and the number of enslaved people who traveled each route. As the figures indicate, most enslaved Africans were bound for Brazil and the Caribbean. While West Africans made up the vast majority of the enslaved, the east coast of Africa, too, supplied enslaved people for the trade.\\n In the New World, the institution of slavery assumed a new aspect when the mercantilist system demanded a permanent, identifiable, and plentiful labor supply. Enslaved Africans were both easily identified (by their skin color) and plentiful, because of the thriving slave trade. This led to a race-based slavery system in the New World unlike any bondage system that had come before. Initially, the Spanish and Portuguese tried to force Native people to farm their crops. However, enslaved Native people often became sick or died from disease or from the overwork and cruel treatment they were subjected to. Although he later repented of his ideas, the great defender of the Native peoples, Bartolomé de Las Casas, seeing the near extinction of the native population, suggested the Spanish send Black (and White) laborers to the Indies. The Portuguese did the same in their portions of the New World, particularly for the sugar plantations in Brazil. These enslaved people were less susceptible to disease, and within fifty years, a change took place: the profitability of the African slave trade, coupled with the seemingly limitless number of potential enslaved people and the Catholic Church’s denunciation of the enslavement of Christians, led race to become a dominant factor in the institution of slavery.\\n In the English colonies along the Atlantic coast, indentured servants initially filled the need for labor in the North, where family farms were the norm. In the South, however, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco, rice, and indigo prevailed, and eventually the supply of indentured servants was insufficient to meet the demand. These workers served only for periods of three to seven years before being freed; a more permanent labor supply was needed. Thus, whereas in Africa permanent, inherited slavery was unknown, and children of those bound in slavery to the tribe usually were free and intermarried with their captors, this changed in the Americas; slavery became permanent, and children born to enslaved people became enslaved. This development, along with slavery’s identification with race, forever changed the institution and shaped its unique character in the New World.</chunk3>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYou are asked to write a main idea multiple-choice question based on an academic text summary provided by the user. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\nNOTE: The user may provide an already generated question with evaluations, in which case you should revise the provided question based on the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] and the evaluations.\\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are main idea questions?**\\nMain idea questions assess a student\\'s ability to identify the central point or primary argument of a text, passage, or section.\\nInstead of focusing on specific details, examples, or minor points, these questions target the big picture — what the author is fundamentally trying to convey.\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Carefully read the TEXT to understand its main idea.  \\nStep2: Write a clear question stem. Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags. The answer should contain the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D) and the text of the correct answer. Example:\\n<ANSWER>A) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.</ANSWER>\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"<text>\\nThe section outlines learning objectives focused on identifying West African empires and discussing the roles of Islam and Europe in the slave trade.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nExplain the factors that contributed to the Nullification Crisis\\nDiscuss the origins and creation of the Whig Party\\nThe crisis over the Tariff of 1828 continued into the 1830s and highlighted one of the currents of democracy in the Age of Jackson: namely, that many southerners believed a democratic majority could be harmful to their interests. These southerners saw themselves as an embattled minority and claimed the right of states to nullify federal laws that appeared to threaten state sovereignty. Another undercurrent was the resentment and anger of the majority against symbols of elite privilege, especially powerful financial institutions like the Second Bank of the United States.\\n THE NULLIFICATION CRISIS\\nThe Tariff of 1828 had driven Vice President Calhoun to pen his “South Carolina Exposition and Protest,” in which he argued that if a national majority acted against the interest of a regional minority, then individual states could void—or nullify—federal law. By the early 1830s, the battle over the tariff took on new urgency as the price of cotton continued to fall. In 1818, cotton had been thirty-one cents per pound. By 1831, it had sunk to eight cents per pound. While production of cotton had soared during this time and this increase contributed to the decline in prices, many southerners blamed their economic problems squarely on the tariff for raising the prices they had to pay for imported goods while their own income shrank.\\n Resentment of the tariff was linked directly to the issue of slavery, because the tariff demonstrated the use of federal power. Some southerners feared the federal government would next take additional action against the South, including the abolition of slavery. The theory of nullification, or the voiding of unwelcome federal laws, provided wealthy slaveholders, who were a minority in the United States, with an argument for resisting the national government if it acted contrary to their interests. James Hamilton, who served as governor of South Carolina in the early 1830s, denounced the “despotic majority that oppresses us.” Nullification also raised the specter of secession; aggrieved states at the mercy of an aggressive majority would be forced to leave the Union.\\n On the issue of nullification, South Carolina stood alone. Other southern states backed away from what they saw as the extremism behind the idea. President Jackson did not make the repeal of the 1828 tariff a priority and denied the nullifiers’ arguments. He and others, including former President Madison, argued that Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gave Congress the power to “lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.” Jackson pledged to protect the Union against those who would try to tear it apart over the tariff issue. “The union shall be preserved,” he declared in 1830.\\n To deal with the crisis, Jackson advocated a reduction in tariff rates. The Tariff of 1832, passed in the summer, lowered the rates on some products like imported goods, a move designed to calm southerners. It did not have the desired effect, however, and Calhoun’s nullifiers still claimed their right to override federal law.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>In November, South Carolina passed the Ordinance of Nullification, declaring the 1828 and 1832 tariffs null and void in the Palmetto State. Jackson responded, however, by declaring in the December 1832 Nullification Proclamation that a state did not have the power to void a federal law.\\n With the states and the federal government at an impasse, civil war seemed a real possibility. The next governor of South Carolina, Robert Hayne, called for a force of ten thousand volunteers (Figure 10.9) to defend the state against any federal action. At the same time, South Carolinians who opposed the nullifiers told Jackson that eight thousand men stood ready to defend the Union. Congress passed the Force Bill of 1833, which gave the federal government the right to use federal troops to ensure compliance with federal law. The crisis—or at least the prospect of armed conflict in South Carolina—was defused by the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which reduced tariff rates considerably. Nullifiers in South Carolina accepted it, but in a move that demonstrated their inflexibility, they nullified the Force Bill.\\n A portrait of Robert Hayne is shown.\\n Figure 10.9 The governor of South Carolina, Robert Hayne, elected in 1832, was a strong proponent of states’ rights and the theory of nullification.\\n The Nullification Crisis illustrated the growing tensions in American democracy: an aggrieved minority of elite, wealthy slaveholders taking a stand against the will of a democratic majority; an emerging sectional divide between South and North over slavery; and a clash between those who believed in free trade and those who believed in protective tariffs to encourage the nation’s economic growth. These tensions would color the next three decades of politics in the United States.\\n THE BANK WAR\\nCongress established the Bank of the United States in 1791 as a key pillar of Alexander Hamilton’s financial program, but its twenty-year charter expired in 1811. Congress, swayed by the majority’s hostility to the bank as an institution catering to the wealthy elite, did not renew the charter at that time. In its place, Congress approved a new national bank—the Second Bank of the United States—in 1816. It too had a twenty-year charter, set to expire in 1836.\\n The Second Bank of the United States was created to stabilize the banking system. More than two hundred banks existed in the United States in 1816, and almost all of them issued paper money. In other words, citizens faced a bewildering welter of paper money with no standard value. In fact, the problem of paper money had contributed significantly to the Panic of 1819.\\n In the 1820s, the national bank moved into a magnificent new building in Philadelphia. However, despite Congress’s approval of the Second Bank of the United States, a great many people continued to view it as tool of the wealthy, an anti-democratic force. President Jackson was among them; he had faced economic crises of his own during his days speculating in land, an experience that had made him uneasy about paper money. To Jackson, hard currency—that is, gold or silver—was the far better alternative.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>The president also personally disliked the bank’s director, Nicholas Biddle.\\n A large part of the allure of mass democracy for politicians was the opportunity to capture the anger and resentment of ordinary Americans against what they saw as the privileges of a few. One of the leading opponents of the bank was Thomas Hart Benton, a senator from Missouri, who declared that the bank served “to make the rich richer, and the poor poorer.” The self-important statements of Biddle, who claimed to have more power than President Jackson, helped fuel sentiments like Benton’s.\\n In the reelection campaign of 1832, Jackson’s opponents in Congress, including Henry Clay, hoped to use their support of the bank to their advantage. In January 1832, they pushed for legislation that would re-charter it, even though its charter was not scheduled to expire until 1836. When the bill for re-chartering passed and came to President Jackson, he used his executive authority to veto the measure.\\n The defeat of the Second Bank of the United States demonstrates Jackson’s ability to focus on the specific issues that aroused the democratic majority. Jackson understood people’s anger and distrust toward the bank, which stood as an emblem of special privilege and big government. He skillfully used that perception to his advantage, presenting the bank issue as a struggle of ordinary people against a rapacious elite class who cared nothing for the public and pursued only their own selfish ends. As Jackson portrayed it, his was a battle for small government and ordinary Americans. His stand against what bank opponents called the “monster bank” proved very popular, and the Democratic press lionized him for it (Figure 10.10). In the election of 1832, Jackson received nearly 53 percent of the popular vote against his opponent Henry Clay.\\n A political cartoon depicts President Jackson using a cane marked “Veto” to battle a many-headed snake representing state banks. Battling alongside Martin Van Buren and Jack Downing, Jackson addresses the largest head, that of Nicholas Biddle, the director of the national bank: “Biddle thou Monster Avaunt!! . . .”\\n Figure 10.10 In General Jackson Slaying the Many Headed Monster (1836), the artist, Henry R. Robinson, depicts President Jackson using a cane marked “Veto” to battle a many-headed snake representing state banks, which supported the national bank. Battling alongside Martin Van Buren and Jack Downing, Jackson addresses the largest head, that of Nicholas Biddle, the director of the national bank: “Biddle thou Monster Avaunt [go away]!! . . .”\\n Jackson’s veto was only one part of the war on the “monster bank.” In 1833, the president removed the deposits from the national bank and placed them in state banks. Biddle, the bank’s director, retaliated by restricting loans to the state banks, resulting in a reduction of the money supply. The financial turmoil only increased when Jackson issued an executive order known as the Specie Circular, which required that western land sales be conducted using gold or silver only. Unfortunately, this policy proved a disaster when the Bank of England, the source of much of the hard currency borrowed by American businesses, dramatically cut back on loans to the United States.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>Without the flow of hard currency from England, American depositors drained the gold and silver from their own domestic banks, making hard currency scarce. Adding to the economic distress of the late 1830s, cotton prices plummeted, contributing to a financial crisis called the Panic of 1837. This economic panic would prove politically useful for Jackson’s opponents in the coming years and Van Buren, elected president in 1836, would pay the price for Jackson’s hard-currency preferences.\\n WHIGS\\nJackson’s veto of the bank and his Specie Circular helped galvanize opposition forces into a new political party, the Whigs, a faction that began to form in 1834. The name was significant; opponents of Jackson saw him as exercising tyrannical power, so they chose the name Whig after the eighteenth-century political party that resisted the monarchical power of King George III. One political cartoon dubbed the president “King Andrew the First” and displayed Jackson standing on the Constitution, which has been ripped to shreds (Figure 10.11).\\n Political caricature (a) represents President Andrew Jackson as a despotic ruler in robes and a crown, holding a scepter in one hand and a veto in the other. The border of the drawing reads “King Andrew the First. Of Veto Memory. Born to Command. Had I Been Consulted.” Cartoon (b) shows Jackson overseeing a scene of uncontrollable chaos. He wields a broom as rats with human heads, representing some of his cabinet members, run around on the floor. A pedestal labeled “Altar of Reform” topples over, while Jackson falls from a collapsing chair labeled “The Hickory Chair coming to pieces at last.”\\nFigure 10.11 This anonymous 1833 political caricature (a) represents President Andrew Jackson as a despotic ruler, holding a scepter in one hand and a veto in the other. Contrast the image of “King Andrew” with a political cartoon from 1831 (b) of Jackson overseeing a scene of uncontrollable chaos as he falls from a hickory chair “coming to pieces at last.”\\n Whigs championed an active federal government committed to internal improvements, including a national bank. They made their first national appearance in the presidential election of 1836, a contest that pitted Jackson’s handpicked successor, Martin Van Buren, against a field of several Whig candidates. Indeed, the large field of Whig candidates indicated the new party’s lack of organization compared to the Democrats. This helped Van Buren, who carried the day in the Electoral College. As the effects of the Panic of 1837 continued to be felt for years afterward, the Whig press pinned the blame for the economic crisis on Van Buren and the Democrats.</chunk4>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

The crisis was tied to tensions over states' rights and fears of federal intervention in slavery. South Carolina's stance on nullification and President Jackson's opposition highlight the period's democratic and sectional conflicts.\\n\\nThe crisis escalated when South Carolina passed the Ordinance of Nullification, leading to threats of secession and federal intervention. A compromise tariff helped diffuse tensions, reflecting underlying regional and economic disagreements between the South and North.\\n\\nThe Bank War centred on the opposition to the Second Bank of the United States, seen as a privilege for the elite. Jackson’s veto of the bank's recharter, championed by popular support, underscored his advocacy for the common man and skepticism towards centralized financial control. Financial policies led to economic instability and were politically pivotal.\\n\\nJackson's actions spurred the formation of the Whig Party, who saw him as a tyrant.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nExplain the legal wrangling that surrounded the Indian Removal Act\\nDescribe how depictions of Native peoples in popular culture helped lead to Native removal\\nDescribe the Indian Removal Act\\'s effect on Native American people, and their responses to it.\\n Pro-Jackson newspapers touted the president as a champion of opening land for White settlement and moving native inhabitants beyond the boundaries of “American civilization.” In this effort, Jackson reflected majority opinion: most Americans believed Native peoples had no place in the White republic. Jackson’s animosity toward Native Americans ran deep. He had fought against the Creek in 1813 and against the Seminole in 1817, and his reputation and popularity rested in large measure on his firm commitment to remove Native residents from states in the South. The 1830 Indian Removal Act and subsequent displacement of the Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole, and Cherokee tribes of the Southeast fulfilled the vision of a White nation and became one of the identifying characteristics of the Age of Jackson.\\n NATIVE AMERICANS IN POPULAR CULTURE\\nPopular culture in the first half of the nineteenth century reflected the aversion to Native Americans that was pervasive during the Age of Jackson. Jackson skillfully played upon this racial hatred to engage the United States in a policy of ethnic cleansing, eradicating the Native presence from the land to make way for White civilization.\\n In an age of mass democracy, powerful anti-Native sentiments found expression in mass culture, shaping popular perceptions. James Fenimore Cooper’s very popular historical novel, The Last of the Mohicans, published in 1826 as part of his Leatherstocking series, told the tale of Nathaniel “Natty” Bumppo (aka Hawkeye), who lived among Native Americans but had been born to White parents. Cooper provides a romantic version of the French and Indian War in which Natty helps the British against the French and the feral, bloodthirsty Huron. Natty endures even as his Native American friends die, including the noble Uncas, the last Mohican, in a narrative that dovetailed with most people’s approval of Native removal.\\n Native Americans also made frequent appearances in art. George Catlin produced many paintings of Native peoples, which he offered as true representations despite routinely emphasizing their supposed \"savage\" nature. The Cutting Scene, Mandan O-kee-pa Ceremony (Figure 10.12) is one example. Scholars have long questioned the accuracy of this portrayal of a rite of passage among the Mandan people. Accuracy aside, the painting captured the imaginations of White viewers, reinforcing their disgust at the savagery of Native Americans.\\n A painting shows several young Native American men suspended by wooden splints, which are stuck through different parts of their bodies. Others participate in the ritual or look on from below.\\n Figure 10.12 The Cutting Scene, Mandan O-kee-pa Ceremony, an 1832 painting by George Catlin, depicts a rite-of-passage ceremony that Catlin said he witnessed. It featured wooden splints inserted into the chest and back muscles of young men. Such paintings increased Native Americans’ reputation as savages.\\n AMERICANA\\nThe Paintings of George Catlin\\nGeorge Catlin seized upon the public fascination with the supposedly exotic and savage Native American, seeing an opportunity to make money by painting them in a way that conformed to popular White stereotypes (Figure 10.13).</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>In the late 1830s, he toured major cities with his Indian Gallery, a collection of paintings of Native peoples. Though he hoped his exhibition would be profitable, it did not bring him financial security.\\n Painting (a) depicts a group of mounted Native Americans on a grizzly bear hunt. Painting (b) shows a Native American chief in two modes of dress: he is clothed in the native fashion, including a feathered headdress, on the left, and wearing a fully western outfit, including top hat, on the right.\\n Figure 10.13 In Attacking the Grizzly Bear (a), painted in 1844, Catlin focused on the Natives’ own vanishing culture, while in Wi-jún-jon, Pigeon’s Egg Head (The Light) Going To and Returning From Washington (b), painted in 1837–1839, he contrasted their ways with those of White people by showing an Assiniboine leader transformed by a visit to Washington, DC.\\n Catlin routinely painted Native Americans in a supposedly aboriginal state. In Attacking the Grizzly Bear, the hunters do not have rifles and instead rely on spears. Such a portrayal stretches credibility as Native peoples had long been exposed to and adopted European weapons. Indeed, the painting’s depiction of Native people riding horses, which were introduced by the Spanish, makes clear that, as much as Catlin and White viewers wanted to believe in the primitive and savage Native, the reality was otherwise.\\n In Wi-jún-jon, Pigeon\\'s Egg Head (The Light) Going To and Returning From Washington, the viewer is shown a before and after portrait of Wi-jún-jon, who tried to emulate White dress and manners after going to Washington, DC. What differences do you see between these two representations of Wi-jún-jon? Do you think his attempt to imitate White people was successful? Why or why not? What do you think Catlin was trying to convey with this depiction of Wi-jún-jon’s assimilation?\\n THE INDIAN REMOVAL ACT\\nIn his first message to Congress, Jackson had proclaimed that Native American groups living independently within states, as sovereign entities, presented a major problem for state sovereignty. This message referred directly to the situation in Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama, where the Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole, and Cherokee peoples stood as obstacles to White settlement. These groups were known as the Five Civilized Tribes, because they had largely adopted Anglo-American culture, speaking English and practicing Christianity. Some held enslaved people like their White counterparts.\\n White people especially resented the Cherokee in Georgia, coveting the tribe’s rich agricultural lands in the northern part of the state. The impulse to remove the Cherokee only increased when gold was discovered on their lands. Ironically, while White people insisted the Cherokee and other Native peoples could never be good citizens because of their savage ways, the Cherokee had arguably gone farther than any other indigenous group in adopting White culture. The Cherokee Phoenix, the newspaper of the Cherokee, began publication in 1828 (Figure 10.14) in English and the Cherokee language. Although the Cherokee followed the lead of their White neighbors by farming and owning property, as well as embracing Christianity and enslaving people, this proved of little consequence in an era when White people perceived all Native Americans as incapable of becoming full citizens of the republic.\\n</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>The front page of the Cherokee Phoenix is shown. The title of the newspaper is provided in Cherokee on top, with an English translation featured below.\\n Figure 10.14 This image depicts the front page of the Cherokee Phoenix newspaper from May 21, 1828. The paper was published in both English and the Cherokee language.\\n Jackson’s anti-Native stance struck a chord with a majority of White citizens, many of whom shared a hatred of non-White people that spurred Congress to pass the 1830 Indian Removal Act. The act called for the removal of the Five Civilized Tribes from their home in the southeastern United States to land in the West, in present-day Oklahoma. Jackson declared in December 1830, “It gives me pleasure to announce to Congress that the benevolent policy of the Government, steadily pursued for nearly thirty years, in relation to the removal of the Native Americans beyond the White settlements is approaching to a happy consummation. Two important tribes have accepted the provision made for their removal at the last session of Congress, and it is believed that their example will induce the remaining tribes also to seek the same obvious advantages.”\\n The Cherokee decided to fight the federal law, however, and took their case to the Supreme Court. Their legal fight had the support of anti-Jackson members of Congress, including Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, and they retained the legal services of former attorney general William Wirt. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, Wirt argued that the Cherokee constituted an independent foreign nation, and that an injunction (a stop) should be placed on Georgia laws aimed at eradicating them. In 1831, the Supreme Court found the Cherokee did not meet the criteria for being a foreign nation.\\n Another case involving the Cherokee also found its way to the highest court in the land. This legal struggle—Worcester v. Georgia—asserted the rights of non-natives to live on Native American lands. Samuel Worcester was a Christian missionary and federal postmaster of New Echota, the capital of the Cherokee nation. A Congregationalist, he had gone to live among the Cherokee in Georgia to further the spread of Christianity, and he strongly opposed Native American removal.\\n By living among the Cherokee, Worcester had violated a Georgia law forbidding White people, unless they were agents of the federal government, to live in Native American territory. Worcester was arrested, but because his federal job as postmaster gave him the right to live there, he was released. Jackson supporters then succeeded in taking away Worcester’s job, and he was re-arrested. This time, a court sentenced him and nine others for violating the Georgia state law banning White people from living on Native land. Worcester was sentenced to four years of hard labor. When the case of Worcester v. Georgia came before the Supreme Court in 1832, Chief Justice John Marshall ruled in favor of Worcester, finding that the Cherokee constituted “distinct political communities” with sovereign rights to their own territory.\\n DEFINING AMERICAN\\nChief Justice John Marshall’s Ruling in Worcester v. Georgia\\nIn 1832, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Marshall ruled in favor of Samuel Worcester in Worcester v. Georgia.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>In doing so, he established the principle of tribal sovereignty. Although this judgment contradicted Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, it failed to halt the Indian Removal Act. In his opinion, Marshall wrote the following:\\n From the commencement of our government Congress has passed acts to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indians; which treat them as nations, respect their rights, and manifest a firm purpose to afford that protection which treaties stipulate. All these acts, and especially that of 1802, which is still in force, manifestly consider the several Indian nations as distinct political communities, having territorial boundaries, within which their authority is exclusive, and having a right to all the lands within those boundaries, which is not only acknowledged, but guaranteed by the United States. . . .\\n The Cherokee Nation, then, is a distinct community, occupying its own territory, with boundaries accurately described, in which the laws of Georgia can have no force, and which the citizens of Georgia have no right to enter but with the assent of the Cherokees themselves or in conformity with treaties and with the acts of Congress. The whole intercourse between the United States and this nation is, by our Constitution and laws, vested in the government of the United States.\\n The act of the State of Georgia under which the plaintiff in error was prosecuted is consequently void, and the judgment a nullity. . . . The Acts of Georgia are repugnant to the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States.\\n How does this opinion differ from the outcome of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia just one year earlier? Why do you think the two outcomes were different?\\n The Supreme Court did not have the power to enforce its ruling in Worcester v. Georgia, however, and it became clear that the Cherokee would be compelled to move. Those who understood that the only option was removal traveled west, but the majority stayed on their land. In order to remove them, the president relied on the U.S. military. In a series of forced marches, some fifteen thousand Cherokee were finally relocated to Oklahoma. This forced migration, known as the Trail of Tears, caused the deaths of as many as four thousand Cherokee (Figure 10.15). The Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole peoples were also compelled to go. The removal of the Five Civilized Tribes provides an example of the power of majority opinion in a democracy.\\n A map shows the routes taken by the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole from the Southeast to an area in the western territory during their forced removal from their homelands.\\n Figure 10.15 After the passage of the Indian Removal Act, the U.S. military forced the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole to relocate from the Southeast to an area in the western territory (now Oklahoma), marching them along the routes shown here.\\nCLICK AND EXPLORE\\nExplore the interactive Trail of Tears map at the National Park Service to see the routes the Cherokee took when they were expelled from their lands. Then listen to a collection of Cherokee oral histories including verses of a Cherokee-language song about the Trail of Tears.</chunk4>\\n\\n<chunk5>What do you think is the importance of oral history in documenting the Cherokee experience?\\n BLACK HAWK’S WAR\\nThe policy of removal led some Native Americans to actively resist. In 1832, the Fox and the Sauk, led by Sauk chief Black Hawk (Makataimeshekiakiah), moved back across the Mississippi River to reclaim their ancestral home in northern Illinois. A brief war in 1832, Black Hawk’s War, ensued. White settlers panicked at the return of the Sauk, and militias and federal troops quickly mobilized. At the Bad Axe Massacre, they killed over two hundred men, women, and children. Some seventy White settlers and soldiers also lost their lives in the conflict (Figure 10.16). The war, which lasted only a matter of weeks, illustrates how much White people on the frontier hated and feared Native Americans during the Age of Jackson.\\n Portrait (a) depicts Sauk chief Black Hawk. Engraving (b) shows U.S. soldiers on a steamer labeled with the name “Warrior” firing on Native Americans aboard a raft on a river.\\n Figure 10.16 Charles Bird King’s 1837 portrait Sauk Chief Makataimeshekiakiah, or Black Hawk (a), depicts the Sauk chief who led the Fox and Sauk peoples in an ill-fated effort to return to their native lands in northern Illinois. This engraving depicting the Bad Axe Massacre (b) shows U.S. soldiers on a steamer firing on Native Americans aboard a raft.

Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nExplain why American settlers in Texas sought independence from Mexico\\nDiscuss early attempts to make Texas independent of Mexico\\nDescribe the relationship between Anglo-Americans and Tejanos in Texas before and after independence\\nAs the incursions of the earlier filibusters into Texas demonstrated, American expansionists had desired this area of Spain’s empire in America for many years. After the 1819 Adams-Onís treaty established the boundary between Mexico and the United States, more American expansionists began to move into the northern portion of Mexico’s province of Coahuila y Texas. Following Mexico’s independence from Spain in 1821, American settlers immigrated to Texas in even larger numbers, intent on taking the land from the new and vulnerable Mexican nation in order to create a new American slave state.\\n AMERICAN SETTLERS MOVE TO TEXAS\\nAfter the 1819 Adams-Onís Treaty defined the U.S.-Mexico boundary, the Spanish Mexican government began actively encouraging Americans to settle their northern province. Texas was sparsely settled, and the few Mexican farmers and ranchers who lived there were under constant threat of attack by tribes, especially the Comanche Empire, which supplemented its hunting with raids in pursuit of horses and cattle.\\n To increase the non-Native population in Texas, provide a buffer zone between its tribes and the rest of Mexico, and provide a bulwark against potential American expansion, Spain began to recruit empresarios. An empresario was someone who brought settlers to the region in exchange for generous grants of land. Moses Austin, a once-prosperous entrepreneur reduced to poverty by the Panic of 1819, requested permission to settle three hundred English-speaking American residents in Texas. Spain agreed on the condition that the resettled people convert to Roman Catholicism.\\n On his deathbed in 1821, Austin asked his son Stephen to carry out his plans, and Mexico, which had won independence from Spain the same year, allowed Stephen to take control of his father’s grant. Like Spain, Mexico also wished to encourage settlement in the state of Coahuila y Texas and passed colonization laws to encourage immigration. Thousands of Americans, primarily from slave states, flocked to Texas and quickly came to outnumber the Tejanos, the Mexican residents of the region. The soil and climate offered good opportunities to expand slavery and the cotton kingdom. Land was plentiful and offered at generous terms. Unlike the U.S. government, Mexico allowed buyers to pay for their land in installments and did not require a minimum purchase. Furthermore, to many White people, it seemed not only their God-given right but also their patriotic duty to populate the lands beyond the Mississippi River, bringing with them American slavery, culture, laws, and political traditions (Figure 11.9).\\n A historical map of the United States is drawn to show a massive eagle encompassing the whole of the nation.\\n Figure 11.9 By the early 1830s, all the lands east of the Mississippi River had been settled and admitted to the Union as states. The land west of the river, though in this contemporary map united with the settled areas in the body of an eagle symbolizing the territorial ambitions of the United States, remained largely unsettled by White Americans.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Texas (just southwest of the bird’s tail feathers) remained outside the U.S. border.\\n THE TEXAS WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE\\nMany Americans who migrated to Texas at the invitation of the Mexican government did not completely shed their identity or loyalty to the United States. They brought American traditions and expectations with them (including, for many, the right to enslave individuals). For instance, the majority of these new settlers were Protestant, and though they were not required to attend the Catholic mass, Mexico’s prohibition on the public practice of other religions upset them and they routinely ignored it.\\n Accustomed to representative democracy, jury trials, and the defendant’s right to appear before a judge, the Anglo-American settlers in Texas also disliked the Mexican legal system, which provided for an initial hearing by an alcalde, an administrator who often combined the duties of mayor, judge, and law enforcement officer. The alcalde sent a written record of the proceeding to a judge in Saltillo, the state capital, who decided the outcome. Settlers also resented that at most two Texas representatives were allowed in the state legislature.\\n Their greatest source of discontent, though, was the Mexican government’s 1829 abolition of slavery. Most American settlers were from southern states, and many had brought enslaved people with them. Mexico tried to accommodate them by maintaining the fiction that the enslaved workers were indentured servants. But American slaveholders in Texas distrusted the Mexican government and wanted Texas to be a new U.S. slave state. The dislike of most for Roman Catholicism (the prevailing religion of Mexico) and a widely held belief in American racial superiority led them generally to regard Mexicans as dishonest, ignorant, and backward.\\n Belief in their own superiority inspired some Texans to try to undermine the power of the Mexican government. When empresario Haden Edwards attempted to evict people who had settled his land grant before he gained title to it, the Mexican government nullified its agreement with him. Outraged, Edwards and a small party of men took prisoner the alcalde of Nacogdoches. The Mexican army marched to the town, and Edwards and his troop then declared the formation of the Republic of Fredonia between the Sabine and Rio Grande Rivers. To demonstrate loyalty to their adopted country, a force led by Stephen Austin hastened to Nacogdoches to support the Mexican army. Edwards’s revolt collapsed, and the revolutionaries fled Texas.\\n The growing presence of American settlers in Texas, their reluctance to abide by Mexican law, and their desire for independence caused the Mexican government to grow wary. In 1830, it forbade future U.S. immigration and increased its military presence in Texas. Settlers continued to stream illegally across the long border; by 1835, after immigration resumed, there were twenty thousand Anglo-Americans in Texas (Figure 11.10).\\n A historical map, entitled “Map of Coahuila and Texas in 1833,” indicates the borders of the various land grants Mexico made to American settlers.\\n Figure 11.10 This 1833 map shows the extent of land grants made by Mexico to American settlers in Texas. Nearly all are in the eastern portion of the state, one factor that led to war with Mexico in 1846.\\n</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Fifty-five delegates from the Anglo-American settlements gathered in 1832 to demand the suspension of customs duties, the resumption of immigration from the United States, the granting of promised land titles, and the creation of an independent state of Texas separate from Coahuila. Ordered to disband, the delegates reconvened in early April 1833 to write a constitution for an independent Texas. Surprisingly, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, Mexico’s new president, agreed to all demands, except the call for statehood (Figure 11.11). Coahuila y Texas made provisions for jury trials, increased Texas’s representation in the state legislature, and removed restrictions on commerce.\\n A portrait of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna is shown.\\n Figure 11.11 This portrait of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna depicts the Mexican president and general in full military regalia.\\n Texans’ hopes for independence were quashed in 1834, however, when Santa Anna dismissed the Mexican Congress and abolished all state governments, including that of Coahuila y Texas. In January 1835, reneging on earlier promises, he dispatched troops to the town of Anahuac to collect customs duties. Lawyer and soldier William B. Travis and a small force marched on Anahuac in June, and the fort surrendered. On October 2, Anglo-American forces met Mexican troops at the town of Gonzales; the Mexican troops fled and the Americans moved on to take San Antonio. Now more cautious, delegates to the Consultation of 1835 at San Felipe de Austin voted against declaring independence, instead drafting a statement, which became known as the Declaration of Causes, promising continued loyalty if Mexico returned to a constitutional form of government. They selected Henry Smith, leader of the Independence Party, as governor of Texas and placed Sam Houston, a former soldier who had been a congressman and governor of Tennessee, in charge of its small military force.\\n The Consultation delegates met again in March 1836. They declared their independence from Mexico and drafted a constitution calling for an American-style judicial system and an elected president and legislature. Significantly, they also established that slavery would not be prohibited in Texas. Many wealthy Tejanos supported the push for independence, hoping for liberal governmental reforms and economic benefits.\\n REMEMBER THE ALAMO!\\n Mexico had no intention of losing its northern province. Santa Anna and his army of four thousand had besieged San Antonio in February 1836. Hopelessly outnumbered, its two hundred defenders, under Travis, fought fiercely from their refuge in an old mission known as the Alamo (Figure 11.12). After ten days, however, the mission was taken and all but a few of the defenders were dead, including Travis and James Bowie, the famed frontiersman who was also a land speculator and slave trader. A few male survivors, possibly including the frontier legend and former Tennessee congressman Davy Crockett, were led outside the walls and executed. The few women and children inside the mission were allowed to leave with the only adult male survivor, a person enslaved by Travis, who was then freed by the Mexican Army. Terrified, they fled.\\n A painting depicts the 1836 assault on the Alamo complex. Lines of uniformed soldiers approach the fort from every direction.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>The defenders are few.\\n Figure 11.12 The Fall of the Alamo, painted by Theodore Gentilz fewer than ten years after this pivotal moment in the Texas Revolution, depicts the 1836 assault on the Alamo complex.\\n Although hungry for revenge, the Texas forces under Sam Houston nevertheless withdrew across Texas, gathering recruits as they went. Coming upon Santa Anna’s encampment on the banks of San Jacinto River on April 21, 1836, they waited as the Mexican troops settled for an afternoon nap. Assured by Houston that “Victory is certain!” and told to “Trust in God and fear not!” the seven hundred men descended on a sleeping force nearly twice their number with cries of “Remember the Alamo!” Within fifteen minutes the Battle of San Jacinto was over. Approximately half the Mexican troops were killed, and the survivors, including Santa Anna, taken prisoner.\\n Santa Anna grudgingly signed a peace treaty and was sent to Washington, where he met with President Andrew Jackson and, under pressure, agreed to recognize an independent Texas with the Rio Grande River as its southwestern border. By the time the agreement had been signed, however, Santa Anna had been removed from power in Mexico. For that reason, the Mexican Congress refused to be bound by Santa Anna’s promises and continued to insist that the renegade territory still belonged to Mexico.\\n CLICK AND EXPLORE\\nVisit the official Alamo website to learn more about the battle of the Alamo and take a virtual tour of the old mission.\\n THE LONE STAR REPUBLIC\\nIn September 1836, military hero Sam Houston was elected president of Texas, and, following the relentless logic of U.S. expansion, Texans voted in favor of annexation to the United States. This had been the dream of many settlers in Texas all along. They wanted to expand the United States west and saw Texas as the next logical step. Slaveholders there, such as Sam Houston, William B. Travis and James Bowie (the latter two of whom died at the Alamo), believed too in the destiny of slavery. Mindful of the vicious debates over Missouri that had led to talk of disunion and war, American politicians were reluctant to annex Texas or, indeed, even to recognize it as a sovereign nation. Annexation would almost certainly mean war with Mexico, and the admission of a state with a large enslaved population, though permissible under the Missouri Compromise, would bring the issue of slavery once again to the fore. Texas had no choice but to organize itself as the independent Lone Star Republic. To protect itself from Mexican attempts to reclaim it, Texas sought and received recognition from France, Great Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The United States did not officially recognize Texas as an independent nation until March 1837, nearly a year after the final victory over the Mexican army at San Jacinto.\\n Uncertainty about its future did not discourage Americans committed to expansion, especially slaveholders, from rushing to settle in the Lone Star Republic, however. Between 1836 and 1846, its population nearly tripled. By 1840, nearly twelve thousand enslaved Africans had been brought to Texas by American slaveholders. Many new settlers had suffered financial losses in the severe financial depression of 1837 and hoped for a new start in the new nation.</chunk4>\\n\\n<chunk5>According to folklore, across the United States, homes and farms were deserted overnight, and curious neighbors found notes reading only “GTT” (“Gone to Texas”). Many Europeans, especially Germans, also immigrated to Texas during this period.\\n Americans in Texas generally treated both Tejano and Native American residents with utter contempt, eager to displace and dispossess them. Anglo-American leaders failed to return the support their Tejano neighbors had extended during the rebellion and repaid them by seizing their lands. In 1839, Mirabeau B. Lamar, the second president of the Lone Star Republic, instituted a program of ethnic cleansing aimed at pushing all Native American tribes out of Texas.\\n The impulse to expand did not lay dormant, and Anglo-American settlers and leaders in the newly formed Texas republic soon cast their gaze on the Mexican province of New Mexico as well. Repeating the tactics of earlier filibusters, a Texas force set out in 1841 intent on taking Santa Fe. Its members encountered an army of New Mexicans and were taken prisoner and sent to Mexico City. On Christmas Day, 1842, Texans avenged a Mexican assault on San Antonio by attacking the Mexican town of Mier. In August, another Texas army was sent to attack Santa Fe, but Mexican troops forced them to retreat. Clearly, hostilities between Texas and Mexico had not ended simply because Texas had declared its independence.</chunk5>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYou are asked to write a main idea multiple-choice question based on an academic text summary provided by the user. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\nNOTE: The user may provide an already generated question with evaluations, in which case you should revise the provided question based on the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] and the evaluations.\\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are main idea questions?**\\nMain idea questions assess a student\\'s ability to identify the central point or primary argument of a text, passage, or section.\\nInstead of focusing on specific details, examples, or minor points, these questions target the big picture — what the author is fundamentally trying to convey.\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Carefully read the TEXT to understand its main idea.  \\nStep2: Write a clear question stem. Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags. The answer should contain the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D) and the text of the correct answer. Example:\\n<ANSWER>A) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.</ANSWER>\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\nIn this chunk, the learning objectives include understanding why American settlers sought independence from Mexico, early efforts for Texas independence, and the relationship between Anglo-Americans and Tejanos.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text.

Instead, the acquisition of new territory revived and intensified the debate over the future of slavery in the western territories, widening the growing division between North and South and leading to the creation of new single-issue parties. Increasingly, the South came to regard itself as under attack by radical northern abolitionists, and many northerners began to speak ominously of a southern drive to dominate American politics for the purpose of protecting slaveholders’ human property. As tensions mounted and both sides hurled accusations, national unity frayed. Compromise became nearly impossible and antagonistic sectional rivalries replaced the idea of a unified, democratic republic.\\n THE LIBERTY PARTY, THE WILMOT PROVISO, AND THE ANTISLAVERY MOVEMENT\\nCommitted to protecting White workers by keeping slavery out of the lands taken from Mexico, Pennsylvania congressman David Wilmot attached to an 1846 revenue bill an amendment that would prohibit slavery in the new territory. The Wilmot Proviso was not entirely new. Other congressmen had drafted similar legislation, and Wilmot’s language was largely copied from the 1787 Northwest Ordinance that had banned slavery in that territory. His ideas were very controversial in the 1840s, however, because his proposals would prevent American slaveholders from bringing what they viewed as their lawful property, enslaved people, into the western lands. The measure passed the House but was defeated in the Senate. When Polk tried again to raise revenue the following year (to pay for lands taken from Mexico), the Wilmot Proviso was reintroduced, this time calling for the prohibition of slavery not only in the Mexican Cession but in all U.S. territories. The revenue bill passed, but without the proviso.\\n That Wilmot, a loyal Democrat, should attempt to counter the actions of a Democratic president hinted at the party divisions that were to come. The 1840s were a particularly active time in the creation and reorganization of political parties and constituencies, mainly because of discontent with the positions of the mainstream Whig and Democratic Parties in regard to slavery and its extension into the territories. The first new party, the small and politically weak Liberty Party founded in 1840, was a single-issue party, as were many of those that followed it. Its members were abolitionists who fervently believed slavery was evil and should be ended, and that this was best accomplished by political means.\\n The Wilmot Proviso captured the “antislavery” sentiments during and after the Mexican War. Antislavery advocates differed from the abolitionists. While abolitionists called for the end of slavery everywhere, antislavery advocates, for various reasons, did not challenge the presence of slavery in the states where it already existed. Those who supported antislavery fervently opposed its expansion westward because, they argued, slavery would degrade White labor and reduce its value, cast a stigma upon hard-working White people, and deprive them of a chance to advance economically.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>The western lands, they argued, should be open to White men only—small farmers and urban workers for whom the West held the promise of economic advancement. Where slavery was entrenched, according to antislavery advocates, there was little land left for small farmers to purchase, and such men could not compete fairly with slaveholders who held large farms and gangs of enslaved people. Ordinary laborers suffered also; no one would pay a White man a decent wage when an enslaved person worked for nothing. When labor was associated with loss of freedom, antislavery supporters argued, all White workers carried a stigma that marked them as little better than the enslaved.\\n Wilmot opposed the extension of slavery into the Mexican Cession not because of his concern for African Americans, but because of his belief that slavery hurt White workers, and that lands acquired by the government should be used to better the position of White small farmers and laborers. Work was not simply something that people did; it gave them dignity, but in a slave society, labor had no dignity. In response to these arguments, southerners maintained that laborers in northern factories were treated worse than enslaved people. Their work was tedious and low paid. Their meager income was spent on inadequate food, clothing, and shelter. There was no dignity in such a life. In contrast, they argued, southern enslaved people were provided with a home, the necessities of life, and the protection of their slaveholders. Factory owners did not care for or protect their employees in the same way.\\n THE FREE-SOIL PARTY AND THE ELECTION OF 1848\\nThe Wilmot Proviso was an issue of great importance to the Democrats. Would they pledge to support it? At the party’s New York State convention in Buffalo, Martin Van Buren’s antislavery supporters—called Barnburners because they were likened to farmers who were willing to burn down their own barn to get rid of a rat infestation—spoke in favor of the proviso. Their opponents, known as Hunkers, refused to support it. Angered, the Barnburners organized their own convention, where they chose antislavery, pro–Wilmot Proviso delegates to send to the Democrats’ national convention in Baltimore. In this way, the controversy over the expansion of slavery divided the Democratic Party.\\n At the national convention, both sets of delegates were seated—the pro-proviso ones chosen by the Barnburners and the anti-proviso ones chosen by the Hunkers. When it came time to vote for the party’s presidential nominee, the majority of votes were for Lewis Cass, an advocate of popular sovereignty. Popular sovereignty was the belief that citizens should be able to decide issues based on the principle of majority rule; in this case, residents of a territory should have the right to decide whether slavery would be allowed in it. Theoretically, this doctrine would allow slavery to become established in any U.S. territory, including those from which it had been banned by earlier laws.\\n Disgusted by the result, the Barnburners united with antislavery Whigs and former members of the Liberty Party to form a new political party—the Free-Soil Party, which took as its slogan “Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor, and Free Men.”</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>The party had one real goal—to oppose the extension of slavery into the territories (Figure 11.21). In the minds of its members and many other northerners of the time, southern slaveholders had marshaled their wealth and power to control national politics for the purpose of protecting the institution of slavery and extending it into the territories. Many in the Free-Soil Party believed in this far-reaching conspiracy of the slaveholding elite to control both foreign affairs and domestic policies for their own ends, a cabal that came to be known as the Slave Power.\\n A cartoon depicts Martin Van Buren and his son John setting fire to a barn, from which smoke billows. Lewis Cass crouches on the roof, preparing to leap. John exclaims “That’s you Dad! more ‘Free Soil.’ We'll rat ‘em out yet. Long life to Davy Wilmot.”\\nFigure 11.21 This political cartoon depicts Martin Van Buren and his son John, both Barnburners, forcing the slavery issue within the Democratic Party by “smoking out” fellow Democrat Lewis Cass on the roof. Their support of the Wilmot Proviso and the new Free-Soil Party is demonstrated by John’s declaration, “That’s you Dad! more ‘Free-Soil.’ We'll rat ‘em out yet. Long life to Davy Wilmot.” (credit: Library of Congress)\\n In the wake of the Mexican War, antislavery sentiment entered mainstream American politics when the new Free-Soil party promptly selected Martin Van Buren as its presidential candidate. For the first time, a national political party committed itself to the goal of stopping the expansion of slavery. The Democrats chose Lewis Cass, and the Whigs nominated General Zachary Taylor, as Polk had assumed they would. On Election Day, Democrats split their votes between Van Buren and Cass. With the strength of the Democratic vote diluted, Taylor won. His popularity with the American people served him well, and his status as a slaveholder helped him win the South.\\nCLICK AND EXPLORE\\nVisit the archives of the Gilder Lehrman Institute to read an August 1848 letter from Gerrit Smith, a staunch abolitionist, regarding the Free-Soil candidate, Martin Van Buren. Smith played a major role in the Liberty Party and was their presidential candidate in 1848.\\n THE COMPROMISE OF 1850\\nThe election of 1848 did nothing to quell the controversy over whether slavery would advance into the Mexican Cession. Some slaveholders, like President Taylor, considered the question a moot point because the lands acquired from Mexico were far too dry for growing cotton and therefore, they thought, no slaveholder would want to move there. Other southerners, however, argued that the question was not whether slaveholders would want to move to the lands of the Mexican Cession, but whether they could and still retain control of their enslaved property. Denying them the right to freely relocate with their lawful property was, they maintained, unfair and unconstitutional. Northerners argued, just as fervidly, that because Mexico had abolished slavery, no enslaved people currently lived in the Mexican Cession, and to introduce slavery there would extend it to a new territory, thus furthering the institution and giving the Slave Power more control over the United States.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>The strong current of antislavery sentiment—that is, the desire to protect White labor—only increased the opposition to the expansion of slavery into the West.\\n Most northerners, except members of the Free-Soil Party, favored popular sovereignty for California and the New Mexico territory. Many southerners opposed this position, however, for they feared residents of these regions might choose to outlaw slavery. Some southern politicians spoke ominously of secession from the United States. Free-Soilers rejected popular sovereignty and demanded that slavery be permanently excluded from the territories.\\n Beginning in January 1850, Congress worked for eight months on a compromise that might quiet the growing sectional conflict. Led by the aged Henry Clay, members finally agreed to the following:\\n1. California, which was ready to enter the Union, was admitted as a free state in accordance with its state constitution.\\n 2. Popular sovereignty was to determine the status of slavery in New Mexico and Utah, even though Utah and part of New Mexico were north of the Missouri Compromise line.\\n 3. The slave trade was banned in the nation’s capital. Slavery, however, was allowed to remain.\\n 4. Under a new fugitive slave law, those who helped escaped enslaved individuals or refused to assist in their return would be fined and possibly imprisoned.\\n 5. The border between Texas and New Mexico was established.\\n The Compromise of 1850 brought temporary relief. It resolved the issue of slavery in the territories for the moment and prevented secession. The peace would not last, however. Instead of relieving tensions between North and South, it had actually made them worse.</chunk4>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

The annexation of new territories reignited the slavery debate, further dividing North and South, leading to political divisions and weakening national unity. The Liberty Party, Wilmot Proviso, and antislavery movements are highlighted. Wilmot’s amendment aimed to prohibit slavery in new territories, indicating growing party divisions. The Liberty Party’s abolitionist stance and the antislavery position—opposing slavery's western expansion to protect White labor—are detailed.\\nThe expansion into western lands raised concerns about competition from slaveholders for land and labor opportunities. Wilmot opposed slavery's extension to protect White workers. Southerners argued their slaves were better cared for than northern factory workers. The Free-Soil Party emerged from divisions over the Wilmot Proviso, emphasizing a platform opposing slavery in territories. Political contention over slavery’s expansion highlighted underlying fears of Southern political control.\\nAfter the Mexican War, antislavery became more politically mainstream, leading to the formation of the Free-Soil Party, which selected Martin Van Buren as its candidate. The 1848 election split Democrats, allowing Zachary Taylor to win. Debates over slavery in the Mexican Cession persisted, with differing opinions on its feasibility for slave agriculture and its constitutional implications.\\nAntislavery sentiment continued to build, with most northerners favoring popular sovereignty for new territories, while Free-Soilers opposed it. The Compromise of 1850 aimed to appease both sides but ultimately deepened divisions.

The annexation of new territories reignited the slavery debate, further dividing North and South, leading to political divisions and weakening national unity. The Liberty Party, Wilmot Proviso, and antislavery movements are highlighted. Wilmot’s amendment aimed to prohibit slavery in new territories, indicating growing party divisions. The Liberty Party’s abolitionist stance and the antislavery position—opposing slavery's western expansion to protect White labor—are detailed.\\nThe expansion into western lands raised concerns about competition from slaveholders for land and labor opportunities. Wilmot opposed slavery's extension to protect White workers. Southerners argued their slaves were better cared for than northern factory workers. The Free-Soil Party emerged from divisions over the Wilmot Proviso, emphasizing a platform opposing slavery in territories. Political contention over slavery’s expansion highlighted underlying fears of Southern political control.\\nAfter the Mexican War, antislavery became more politically mainstream, leading to the formation of the Free-Soil Party, which selected Martin Van Buren as its candidate. The 1848 election split Democrats, allowing Zachary Taylor to win. Debates over slavery in the Mexican Cession persisted, with differing opinions on its feasibility for slave agriculture and its constitutional implications.\\nAntislavery sentiment continued to build, with most northerners favoring popular sovereignty for new territories, while Free-Soilers opposed it. The Compromise of 1850 aimed to appease both sides but ultimately deepened divisions. The agreement included admitting California as a free state and determining slavery in other territories by popular sovereignty, among other provisions.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\n\\n</contextual_text>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs.

This largely pre-capitalist culture centered on large family units whose members all lived in the same towns, counties, and parishes.\\n Economic forces unleashed after 1815, however, forever altered that world. More and more people now bought their food and goods in the thriving market economy, a shift that opened the door to a new way of life. These economic transformations generated various reactions; some people were nostalgic for what they viewed as simpler, earlier times, whereas others were willing to try new ways of living and working. In the early nineteenth century, experimental communities sprang up, created by men and women who hoped not just to create a better way of life but to recast American civilization, so that greater equality and harmony would prevail. Indeed, some of these reformers envisioned the creation of alternative ways of living, where people could attain perfection in human relations. The exact number of these societies is unknown because many of them were so short-lived, but the movement reached its apex in the 1840s.\\n RELIGIOUS UTOPIAN SOCIETIES\\nMost of those attracted to utopian communities had been profoundly influenced by evangelical Protestantism, especially the Second Great Awakening. However, their experience of revivalism had left them wanting to further reform society. The communities they formed and joined adhered to various socialist ideas and were considered radical, because members wanted to create a new social order, not reform the old.\\n German Protestant migrants formed several pietistic societies: communities that stressed transformative individual religious experience or piety over religious rituals and formality. One of the earliest of these, the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania, was founded by a charismatic leader named Conrad Beissel in the 1730s. By the antebellum era, it was the oldest communal experiment in the United States. Its members devoted themselves to spiritual contemplation and a disciplined work regime while they awaited the millennium. They wore homespun rather than buying cloth or premade clothing, and encouraged celibacy. Although the Ephrata Cloister remained small, it served as an early example of the type of community that antebellum reformers hoped to create.\\n In 1805, a second German religious society, led by George Rapp, took root in Pennsylvania with several hundred members called Rappites who encouraged celibacy and adhered to the socialist principle of holding all goods in common (as opposed to allowing individual ownership). They not only built the town of Harmony but also produced surplus goods to sell to the outside world. In 1815, the group sold its Pennsylvanian holdings and moved to Indiana, establishing New Harmony on a twenty-thousand-acre plot along the Wabash River. In 1825, members returned to Pennsylvania, and established themselves in the town called Economy.\\n The Shakers provide another example of a community established with a religious mission. The Shakers started in England as an outgrowth of the Quaker religion in the middle of the eighteenth century.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Ann Lee, a leader of the group in England, emigrated to New York in the 1770s, having experienced a profound religious awakening that convinced her that she was “mother in Christ.” She taught that God was both male and female; Jesus embodied the male side, while Mother Ann (as she came to be known by her followers) represented the female side. To Shakers in both England and the United States, Mother Ann represented the completion of divine revelation and the beginning of the millennium of heaven on earth.\\n In practice, men and women in Shaker communities were held as equals—a radical departure at the time—and women often outnumbered men. Equality extended to the possession of material goods as well; no one could hold private property. Shaker communities aimed for self-sufficiency, raising food and making all that was necessary, including furniture that emphasized excellent workmanship as a substitute for worldly pleasure.\\n The defining features of the Shakers were their spiritual mysticism and their prohibition of sexual intercourse, which they held as an example of a lesser spiritual life and a source of conflict between women and men. Rapturous Shaker dances, for which the group gained notoriety, allowed for emotional release (Figure 13.8). The high point of the Shaker movement came in the 1830s, when about six thousand members populated communities in New England, New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky.\\n An illustration depicts a mass of people dancing in concentric circles, arms raised, with men and women alternating. Others watch from rows of seats; men sit in one section and women in another.\\n Figure 13.8 In this image of a Shaker dance from 1840, note the raised arms, indicating emotional expression.\\n CLICK AND EXPLORE\\nLearn more about the musical heritage of the Shakers, including the well-known song “Simple Gifts,” which has become part of American culture.\\n Another religious utopian experiment, the Oneida Community, began with the teachings of John Humphrey Noyes, a Vermonter who had graduated from Dartmouth, Andover Theological Seminary, and Yale. The Second Great Awakening exerted a powerful effect on him, and he came to believe in perfectionism, the idea that it is possible to be perfect and free of sin. Noyes claimed to have achieved this state of perfection in 1834.\\n Noyes applied his idea of perfection to relationships between men and women, earning notoriety for his unorthodox views on marriage and sexuality. Beginning in his home town of Putney, Vermont, he began to advocate what he called “complex marriage:” a form of communal marriage in which women and men who had achieved perfection could engage in sexual intercourse without sin. Noyes also promoted “male continence,” whereby men would not ejaculate, thereby freeing women from pregnancy and the difficulty of determining paternity when they had many partners. Intercourse became fused with spiritual power among Noyes and his followers.\\n The concept of complex marriage scandalized the townspeople in Putney, so Noyes and his followers removed to Oneida, New York. Individuals who wanted to join the Oneida Community underwent a tough screening process to weed out those who had not reached a state of perfection, which Noyes believed promoted self-control, not out-of-control behavior.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>The goal was a balance between individuals in a community of love and respect. The perfectionist community Noyes envisioned ultimately dissolved in 1881, although the Oneida Community itself continues to this day (Figure 13.9).\\n A photograph depicts a large, opulent house surrounded by a lawn on which men, women, and children sit, stand, and converse.\\n Figure 13.9 The Oneida Community was a utopian experiment located in Oneida, New York, from 1848 to 1881.\\n The most successful religious utopian community to arise in the antebellum years was begun by Joseph Smith. Smith came from a large Vermont family that had not prospered in the new market economy and moved to the town of Palmyra, in the “burned over district” of western New York. In 1823, Smith indicated that he had been visited by the angel Moroni, who told him the location of a trove of golden plates or tablets. During the late 1820s, Smith translated the writing on the golden plates, and in 1830, he published his finding as The Book of Mormon. That same year, he organized the Church of Christ, the progenitor of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints then popularly known as Mormons. He presented himself as a prophet and aimed to recapture what he viewed as the purity of the primitive Christian church, purity that had been lost over the centuries.\\n Smith emphasized the importance of families being led by fathers. His vision of a reinvigorated patriarchy resonated with men and women who had not thrived during the market revolution, and his claims attracted those who hoped for a better future. Smith’s new church placed great stress on work and discipline. He aimed to create a New Jerusalem where the church exercised oversight of its members.\\n Smith’s claims of translating the golden plates antagonized his neighbors in New York. Difficulties with anti-Mormons led him and his followers to move to Kirtland, Ohio, in 1831. By 1838, as the United States experienced continued economic turbulence following the Panic of 1837, Smith and his followers were facing financial collapse after a series of efforts in banking and money-making ended in disaster. They moved to Missouri, but trouble soon developed there as well, as citizens reacted against the Church members’ beliefs. Actual fighting broke out in 1838, and the ten thousand or so members of the Church of Jesus Christ removed to Nauvoo, Illinois, where they founded a new center of Mormonism.\\n By the 1840s, Nauvoo boasted a population of thirty thousand, making it the largest utopian community in the United States. Thanks to some important conversions among powerful citizens in Illinois, the Church members had virtual autonomy in Nauvoo, which they used to create the largest armed force in the state. Smith also received further revelations there, including one that allowed male church leaders to practice polygamy. He also declared that all of North and South America would be the new Zion and announced that he would run for president in the 1844 election.\\n Smith and the Church members’ convictions and practices generated a great deal of opposition from neighbors in surrounding towns. Smith was arrested for treason (for his role in the destruction of the printing press of a newspaper that criticized Mormonism), and while he was in prison, an anti-Mormon mob stormed into his cell and killed him.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>Brigham Young (Figure 13.10) then assumed leadership of the group, which he led to a permanent home in what is now Salt Lake City, Utah.\\n Illustration (a) depicts a wooded clearing in which a bearded, white-robed angel delivers the Book of Mormon to Joseph Smith, who kneels at the angel’s feet in a dark suit. Photograph (b) is a portrait of Joseph Smith.\\n Figure 13.10 Carl Christian Anton Christensen depicts The angel Moroni delivering the plates of the Book of Mormon to Joseph Smith, circa 1886 (a). On the basis of these plates, Joseph Smith (b) founded the Church of Latter-Day Saints. Following Smith’s death at the hands of a mob in Illinois, Brigham Young took control of the church and led them west to the Salt Lake Valley, which at that time was still part of Mexico.\\n SECULAR UTOPIAN SOCIETIES\\nNot all utopian communities were prompted by the religious fervor of the Second Great Awakening; some were outgrowths of the intellectual ideas of the time, such as romanticism with its emphasis on the importance of individualism over conformity. One of these, Brook Farm, took shape in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, in the 1840s. It was founded by George Ripley, a transcendentalist from Massachusetts. In the summer of 1841, this utopian community gained support from Boston-area thinkers and writers, an intellectual group that included many important transcendentalists. Brook Farm is best characterized as a community of intensely individualistic personalities who combined manual labor, such as the growing and harvesting food, with intellectual pursuits. They opened a school that specialized in the liberal arts rather than rote memorization and published a weekly journal called The Harbinger, which was “Devoted to Social and Political Progress” (Figure 13.11). Members of Brook Farm never totaled more than one hundred, but it won renown largely because of the luminaries, such as Emerson and Thoreau, whose names were attached to it. Nathaniel Hawthorne, a Massachusetts writer who took issue with some of the transcendentalists’ claims, was a founding member of Brook Farm, and he fictionalized some of his experiences in his novel The Blithedale Romance. In 1846, a fire destroyed the main building of Brook Farm, and already hampered by financial problems, the Brook Farm experiment came to an end in 1847.\\n Image (a) shows the front page of The Harbinger. Photograph (b) is a portrait of George Ripley.\\n Figure 13.11 Brook Farm printed The Harbinger (a) to share its ideals more widely. George Ripley (b), who founded the farm, was burdened with a huge debt several years later when the community collapsed.\\n Robert Owen, a British industrialist, helped inspire those who dreamed of a more equitable world in the face of the changes brought about by industrialization. Owen had risen to prominence before he turned thirty by running cotton mills in New Lanark, Scotland; these were considered the most successful cotton mills in Great Britain. Owen was very uneasy about the conditions of workers, and he devoted both his life and his fortune to trying to create cooperative societies where workers would lead meaningful, fulfilled lives.</chunk4>\\n\\n<chunk5>Unlike the founders of many utopian communities, he did not gain inspiration from religion; his vision derived instead from his faith in human reason to make the world better.\\n When the Rappite community in Harmony, Indiana, decided to sell its holdings and relocate to Pennsylvania, Owen seized the opportunity to put his ideas into action. In 1825, he bought the twenty-thousand-acre parcel in Indiana and renamed it New Harmony (Figure 13.12). After only a few years, however, a series of bad decisions by Owen and infighting over issues like the elimination of private property led to the dissolution of the community. But Owen’s ideas of cooperation and support inspired other “Owenite” communities in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain.\\n An engraving depicts an aerial view of a peaceful bucolic landscape with a massive walled compound at its center. Within the compound, several large buildings, including an industrial building from which steam rises, are visible. From a nearby hill, a small group of adults and children gaze at the community.\\n Figure 13.12 This 1838 engraving of New Harmony shows the ideal collective community that Robert Owen hoped to build.\\n A French philosopher who advocated the creation of a new type of utopian community, Charles Fourier also inspired American readers, notably Arthur Brisbane, who popularized Fourier’s ideas in the United States. Fourier emphasized collective effort by groups of people or “associations.” Members of the association would be housed in large buildings or “phalanxes,” a type of communal living arrangement. Converts to Fourier’s ideas about a new science of living published and lectured vigorously. They believed labor was a type of capital, and the more unpleasant the job, the higher the wages should be. Fourierists in the United States created some twenty-eight communities between 1841 and 1858, but by the late 1850s, the movement had run its course in the United States.</chunk5>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYou are asked to write a main idea multiple-choice question based on an academic text summary provided by the user. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\nNOTE: The user may provide an already generated question with evaluations, in which case you should revise the provided question based on the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] and the evaluations.\\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are main idea questions?**\\nMain idea questions assess a student\\'s ability to identify the central point or primary argument of a text, passage, or section.\\nInstead of focusing on specific details, examples, or minor points, these questions target the big picture — what the author is fundamentally trying to convey.\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Carefully read the TEXT to understand its main idea.  \\nStep2: Write a clear question stem. Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags. The answer should contain the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D) and the text of the correct answer. Example:\\n<ANSWER>A) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.</ANSWER>\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"<text>\\nThis section outlines learning objectives related to comparing utopian groups of the antebellum era and examining the differences between religious and nonreligious utopian communities.

Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text.

Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nExplain the different reforms aimed at improving the health of the human body\\nDescribe the various factions and concerns within the temperance movement\\nAntebellum reform efforts aimed at perfecting the spiritual and social worlds of individuals, and as an outgrowth of those concerns, some reformers moved in the direction of ensuring the health of American citizens. Many Americans viewed drunkenness as a major national problem, and the battle against alcohol and the many problems associated with it led many to join the temperance movement. Other reformers offered plans to increase physical well-being, instituting plans designed to restore vigor. Still others celebrated new sciences that would unlock the mysteries of human behavior and, by doing so, advance American civilization.\\n TEMPERANCE\\nAccording to many antebellum reformers, intemperance (drunkenness) stood as the most troubling problem in the United States, one that eroded morality, Christianity, and played a starring role in corrupting American democracy. Americans consumed huge quantities of liquor in the early 1800s, including gin, whiskey, rum, and brandy. Scholars agree that the rate of consumption of these drinks during the first three decades of the 1800s reached levels that have never been equaled in American history.\\n A variety of reformers created organizations devoted to temperance, that is, moderation or self-restraint. Each of these organizations had its own distinct orientation and target audience. The earliest ones were formed in the 1810s in New England. The Massachusetts Society for the Suppression of Intemperance and the Connecticut Society for the Reformation of Morals were both formed in 1813. Protestant ministers led both organizations, which enjoyed support from New Englanders who clung to the ideals of the Federalist Party and later the Whigs. These early temperance societies called on individuals to lead pious lives and avoid sin, including the sin of overindulging in alcohol. They called not for the eradication of drinking but for a more restrained and genteel style of imbibing.\\n AMERICANA\\nThe Drunkard’s Progress\\nThis 1840 temperance illustration (Figure 13.13) charts the path of destruction for those who drink. The step-by-step progression reads:\\nStep 1. A glass with a friend.\\n Step 2. A glass to keep the cold out.\\n Step 3. A glass too much.\\n Step 4. Drunk and riotous.\\n Step 5. The summit attained. Jolly companions. A confirmed drunkard.\\n Step 6. Poverty and disease.\\n Step 7. Forsaken by Friends.\\n Step 8. Desperation and crime.\\n Step 9. Death by suicide.\\n An illustration, The Drunkards Progress. From the First Glass to the Grave, shows a staircase that rises on one side and descends on the other. A scene of a drinking man is depicted on each step, with text describing his progressive downfall through drink: Step 1. A glass with a friend. Step 2. A glass to keep the cold out. Step 3. A glass too much. Step 4. Drunk and riotous. Step 5. The summit attained. Jolly companions. A confirmed drunkard. Step 6.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Poverty and disease. Step 7. Forsaken by Friends. Step 8. Desperation and crime. Step 9. Death by suicide.” At the bottom is an illustration of a woman with her face in her hand, leading her child from their home.\\n Figure 13.13 This 1846 image, The Drunkards Progress. From the First Glass to the Grave, by Nathaniel Currier, shows the destruction that prohibitionists thought could result from drinking alcoholic beverages.\\n Who do you think was the intended audience for this engraving? How do you think different audiences (children, drinkers, nondrinkers) would react to the story it tells? Do you think it is an effective piece of propaganda? Why or why not?\\n In the 1820s, temperance gained ground largely through the work of Presbyterian minister Lyman Beecher. In 1825, Beecher delivered six sermons on temperance that were published the follow year as Six Sermons on the Nature, Occasions, Signs, Evils, and Remedy of Intemperance. He urged total abstinence from hard liquor and called for the formation of voluntary associations to bring forth a new day without spirits (whiskey, rum, gin, brandy). Lyman’s work enjoyed a wide readership and support from leading Protestant ministers as well as the emerging middle class; temperance fit well with the middle-class ethic of encouraging hard work and a sober workforce.\\n In 1826, the American Temperance Society was formed, and by the early 1830s, thousands of similar societies had sprouted across the country. Members originally pledged to shun only hard liquor. By 1836, however, leaders of the temperance movement, including Beecher, called for a more comprehensive approach. Thereafter, most temperance societies advocated total abstinence; no longer would beer and wine be tolerated. Such total abstinence from alcohol is known as teetotalism.\\n Teetotalism led to disagreement within the movement and a loss of momentum for reform after 1836. However, temperance enjoyed a revival in the 1840s, as a new type of reformer took up the cause against alcohol. The engine driving the new burst of enthusiastic temperance reform was the Washington Temperance Society (named in deference to George Washington), which organized in 1840. The leaders of the Washingtonians came not from the ranks of Protestant ministers but from the working class. They aimed their efforts at confirmed alcoholics, unlike the early temperance advocates who mostly targeted the middle class.\\n Alcohol abuse by men negatively impacted women by misdirecting money necessary to support the household and through physical and emotional abuse from inebriated men. Women argued that refraining from drink would make the world a better place for women and children, and so became key participants in the movement. Washingtonians welcomed the participation of women and children, since they were directly impacted by alcoholism, and those who joined the group took a public pledge of teetotalism. Americans flocked to the Washingtonians; as many as 600,000 had taken the pledge by 1844. The huge surge in membership had much to do with the style of this reform effort. The Washingtonians turned temperance into theater by dramatizing the plight of those who fell into the habit of drunkenness. Perhaps the most famous fictional drama put forward by the temperance movement was Ten Nights in a Bar-Room (1853), a novel that became the basis for popular theatrical productions.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>The Washingtonians also sponsored picnics and parades that drew whole families into the movement. The group’s popularity quickly waned in the late 1840s and early 1850s, when questions arose about the effectiveness of merely taking a pledge. Many who had done so soon relapsed into alcoholism.\\n Still, by that time, temperance had risen to a major political issue. Reformers lobbied for laws limiting or prohibiting alcohol, and states began to pass the first temperance laws. The earliest, an 1838 law in Massachusetts, prohibited the sale of liquor in quantities less than fifteen gallons, a move designed to make it difficult for ordinary workmen of modest means to buy spirits. The law was repealed in 1840, but Massachusetts towns then took the initiative by passing local laws banning alcohol. In 1845, close to one hundred towns in the state went “dry.”\\n An 1839 Mississippi law, similar to Massachusetts’ original law, outlawed the sale of less than a gallon of liquor. Mississippi’s law illustrates the national popularity of temperance; regional differences notwithstanding, citizens in northern and southern states agreed on the issue of alcohol. Nonetheless, northern states pushed hardest for outlawing alcohol. Maine enacted the first statewide prohibition law in 1851. New England, New York, and states in the Midwest passed local laws in the 1850s, prohibiting the sale and manufacture of intoxicating beverages.\\n In 1873, a group of women in New York and Ohio began a series of \"Womans Crusades,\" during which they marched to saloons and asked the owners to stop selling alcohol to their husbands. Initially, hundreds of establishments suspended sales of the beverages, but they soon resumed operations. In response, leaders such Annie Wittenmyer, Francis Willard, and Matilda Gilruth Carpenter formed the National Women’s Christian Temperance Union (sometimes referred to as a Movement) to promote alcohol abstinence. By 1890, the National Women’s Christian Temperance Union was the largest women’s organization in the world. It petitioned for a constitutional amendment against the sale and consumption of alcohol.\\n REFORMS FOR THE BODY AND THE MIND\\nBeyond temperance, other reformers looked to ways to maintain and improve health in a rapidly changing world. Without professional medical organizations or standards, health reform went in many different directions; although the American Medical Association was formed in 1847, it did not have much power to oversee medical practices. Too often, quack doctors prescribed regimens and medicines that did far more harm that good.\\n Sylvester Graham stands out as a leading light among the health reformers in the antebellum years. A Presbyterian minister, Graham began his career as a reformer, lecturing against the evils of strong drink. He combined an interest in temperance with vegetarianism and sexuality into what he called a “Science of Human Life,” calling for a regimented diet of more vegetables, fruits, and grain, and no alcohol, meat, or spices.\\n Graham advocated baths and cleanliness in general to preserve health; hydropathy, or water cures for various ailments, became popular in the United States in the 1840s and 1850s. He also viewed masturbation and excessive sex as a cause of disease and debility. His ideas led him to create what he believed to be a perfect food that would maintain health: the Graham cracker, which he invented in 1829.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>Followers of Graham, known as Grahamites, established boardinghouses where lodgers followed the recommended strict diet and sexual regimen.\\n During the early nineteenth century, reformers also interested themselves in the workings of the mind in an effort to better understand the effects of a rapidly changing world awash with religious revivals and democratic movements. Phrenology—the mapping of the cranium to specific human attributes—stands as an early type of science, related to what would become psychology and devoted to understanding how the mind worked. Although their theories would ultimately be proven wrong, phrenologists believed that the mind contained thirty-seven “faculties,” the strengths or weaknesses of which could be determined by a close examination of the size and shape of the cranium (Figure 13.14).\\n The March 1848 cover of the American Phrenological Journal depicts a human head; the brain region contains a series of vignettes showing the various faculties of the mind.\\n Figure 13.14 This March 1848 cover of the American Phrenological Journal illustrates the different faculties of the mind as envisioned by phrenologists.\\n Initially developed in Europe by Franz Joseph Gall, a German doctor, phrenology first came to the United States in the 1820s. In the 1830s and 1840s, it grew in popularity as lecturers crisscrossed the republic. It was sometimes used as an educational test, and like temperance, it also became a form of popular entertainment. While phrenology is now considered pseudoscience, Gall\\'s assertion that different parts of the brain were responsible for different functions is viewed as an important scientific advance.\\n CLICK AND EXPLORE\\nMap the brain! Check out all thirty-seven of phrenology’s purported faculties of the mind.\\n The popularity of phrenology offers us some insight into the emotional world of the antebellum United States. Its popularity speaks to the desire of those living in a rapidly changing society, where older ties to community and family were being challenged, to understand one another. It appeared to offer a way to quickly recognize an otherwise-unknown individual as a readily understood set of human faculties.</chunk4>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Drunkenness was viewed as a major issue, leading to the temperance movement. Early temperance organizations aimed for moderation and were led by Protestant ministers. A famous temperance illustration, 'The Drunkard's Progress,' depicts the destructive path of drinking.   In the 1820s, Lyman Beecher's influential sermons advocated for total abstinence from hard liquor, leading to a widespread temperance movement. The Washington Temperance Society, formed in 1840, aimed its efforts at alcoholics and included women and children. Their theatrical approach attracted many supporters, including 600,000 pledge signers by 1844.   By the late 1840s, temperance became a political issue with states enacting laws to limit alcohol. Women's groups like the Women's Christian Temperance Union emerged, pushing for prohibition. Health reformers like Sylvester Graham promoted dietary changes and cleanliness, while phrenology attempted to map the mind through cranial examination.

Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs.

For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text.

The nation needed a strong personality to lead it, and Buchanan did not possess this trait. The violence in Kansas demonstrated that applying popular sovereignty—the democratic principle of majority rule—to the territory offered no solution to the national battle over slavery. A decision by the Supreme Court in 1857, which concerned the enslaved Dred Scott, only deepened the crisis.\\n DRED SCOTT\\nIn 1857, just days after President Buchanan took the oath of office, the Supreme Court ruled in Dred Scott v. Sandford. Dred Scott (Figure 14.16), born with slave status in Virginia in 1795, had been one of the thousands forced to relocate as a result of the massive internal slave trade and taken to Missouri, where slavery had been adopted as part of the Missouri Compromise. In 1820, Scott’s owner took him first to Illinois and then to the Wisconsin territory. However, both of those regions were part of the Northwest Territory, where the 1787 Northwest Ordinance had prohibited slavery. When Scott returned to Missouri, he attempted to buy his freedom. After his owner refused, he sought relief in the state courts, arguing that by virtue of having lived in areas where slavery was banned, he should be free.\\n A portrait of Dred Scott is shown.\\n Figure 14.16 This 1888 portrait by Louis Schultze shows Dred Scott, who fought for his freedom through the American court system.\\n In a complicated set of legal decisions, a jury found that Scott, along with his wife and two children, were free. However, on appeal from Scott’s owner, the state Superior Court reversed the decision, and the Scotts remained enslaved. Scott then became the property of John Sanford (his name was misspelled as “Sandford” in later court documents), who lived in New York. He continued his legal battle, and because the issue involved Missouri and New York, the case fell under the jurisdiction of the federal court. In 1854, Scott lost in federal court and appealed to the United States Supreme Court.\\n In 1857, the Supreme Court—led by Chief Justice Roger Taney, a former slaveholder who had freed his those he had enslaved—handed down its decision. On the question of whether Scott was free, the Supreme Court decided he remained enslaved. The court then went beyond the specific issue of Scott’s freedom to make a sweeping and momentous judgment about the status of Black people, both free and enslaved. Per the court, Black people could never be citizens of the United States. Further, the court ruled that Congress had no authority to stop or limit the spread of slavery into American territories. This proslavery ruling explicitly made the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional; implicitly, it made Douglas’s popular sovereignty unconstitutional.\\n DEFINING AMERICAN\\nRoger Taney on Dred Scott v. Sandford\\nIn 1857, the United States Supreme Court ended years of legal battles when it ruled that Dred Scott, an enslaved person who had resided in several free states, should remain enslaved.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>The decision, written by Chief Justice Roger Taney, also stated that Black people could not be citizens and that Congress had no power to limit the spread of slavery. The excerpt below is from Taney’s decision.\\n A free negro of the African race, whose ancestors were brought to this country and sold as slaves, is not a “citizen” within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States. . . .\\n The only two clauses in the Constitution which point to this race treat them as persons whom it was morally lawfully to deal in as articles of property and to hold as slaves. . . .\\n Every citizen has a right to take with him into the Territory any article of property which the Constitution of the United States recognises as property. . . .\\n The Constitution of the United States recognises slaves as property, and pledges the Federal Government to protect it. And Congress cannot exercise any more authority over property of that description than it may constitutionally exercise over property of any other kind. . . .\\n Prohibiting a citizen of the United States from taking with him his slaves when he removes to the Territory . . . is an exercise of authority over private property which is not warranted by the Constitution, and the removal of the plaintiff [Dred Scott] by his owner to that Territory gave him no title to freedom.\\n How did the Supreme Court define Dred Scott? How did the court interpret the Constitution on this score?\\n The Dred Scott decision infuriated Republicans by rendering their goal—to prevent slavery’s spread into the territories—unconstitutional. To Republicans, the decision offered further proof of the reach of the South’s Slave Power, which now apparently extended even to the Supreme Court. The decision also complicated life for northern Democrats, especially Stephen Douglas, who could no longer sell popular sovereignty as a symbolic concession to southerners from northern voters. Few northerners favored slavery’s expansion westward.\\n THE LINCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATES\\nThe turmoil in Kansas, combined with the furor over the Dred Scott decision, provided the background for the 1858 senatorial contest in Illinois between Democratic senator Stephen Douglas and Republican hopeful Abraham Lincoln (Figure 14.17). Lincoln and Douglas engaged in seven debates before huge crowds that met to hear the two men argue the central issue of slavery and its expansion. Newspapers throughout the United States published their speeches. Whereas Douglas already enjoyed national recognition, Lincoln remained largely unknown before the debates. These appearances provided an opportunity for him to raise his profile with both northerners and southerners.\\n Photograph (a) is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. Photograph (b) is a portrait of Stephen Douglas.\\n Figure 14.17 In 1858, Abraham Lincoln (a) debated Stephen Douglas (b) seven times in the Illinois race for the U.S. Senate. Although Douglas won the seat, the debates propelled Lincoln into the national political spotlight.\\n Douglas portrayed the Republican Party as an abolitionist effort—one that aimed to bring about miscegenation, or race-mixing through sexual relations or marriage. The “Black Republicans,” Douglas declared, posed a dangerous threat to the Constitution.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Indeed, because Lincoln declared the nation could not survive if the slave state–free state division continued, Douglas claimed the Republicans aimed to destroy what the founders had created.\\n For his part, Lincoln said: “A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half Slave and half Free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction: or its advocates will push it forward till it shall became alike lawful in all the States—old as well as new, North as well as South.” Lincoln interpreted the Dred Scott decision and the Kansas-Nebraska Act as efforts to nationalize slavery: that is, to make it legal everywhere from New England to the Midwest and beyond.\\n DEFINING AMERICAN\\n The Lincoln-Douglas Debates\\nOn August 21, 1858, Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas met in Ottawa, Illinois, for the first of seven debates. People streamed into Ottawa from neighboring counties and from as far away as Chicago. Reporting on the event was strictly partisan, with each of the candidates’ supporters claiming victory for their candidate. In this excerpt, Lincoln addresses the issues of equality between Black and White people.\\n [A]nything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, . . . I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, . . . I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position. . . . [N]otwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the White man. . . . [I]n the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.\\n —Lincoln’s speech on August 21, 1858, in Ottawa, Illinois\\nHow would you characterize Lincoln’s position on equality between Black and White people? What types of equality exist, according to Lincoln?\\nCLICK AND EXPLORE\\nGo to the Lincoln Home National Historic Site on the National Park Service’s website to read excerpts from and full texts of the debates.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>Then, visit The Lincoln/Douglas Debates of 1858 on the Northern Illinois University website to read different newspaper accounts of the debates. Do you see any major differences in the way the newspapers reported the debates? How does the commentary vary, and why?\\n During the debates, Lincoln demanded that Douglas explain whether or not he believed that the 1857 Supreme Court decision in the Dred Scott case trumped the right of a majority to prevent the expansion of slavery under the principle of popular sovereignty. Douglas responded to Lincoln during the second debate at Freeport, Illinois. In what became known as the Freeport Doctrine, Douglas adamantly upheld popular sovereignty, declaring: “It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under the Constitution, the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please.” The Freeport Doctrine antagonized southerners who supported slavery, and caused a major rift in the Democratic Party. The doctrine did help Douglas in Illinois, however, where most voters opposed the further expansion of slavery. The Illinois legislature selected Douglas over Lincoln for the senate, but the debates had the effect of launching Lincoln into the national spotlight. Lincoln had argued that slavery was morally wrong, even as he accepted the racism inherent in slavery. He warned that Douglas and the Democrats would nationalize slavery through the policy of popular sovereignty. Though Douglas had survived the senate election challenge from Lincoln, his Freeport Doctrine damaged the political support he needed from the Southern Democrats. This helped him to lose the following presidential election, undermining the Democratic Party as a national force.</chunk4>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags.

Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text.

Lincoln’s 1858 speeches during his debates with Douglas made the Republican Party’s position well known; Republicans opposed the extension of slavery and believed a Slave Power conspiracy sought to nationalize the institution. They quickly gained political momentum and took control of the House of Representatives in 1858. Southern leaders were divided on how to respond to Republican success. Southern extremists, known as “Fire-Eaters,” openly called for secession. Others, like Mississippi senator Jefferson Davis, put forward a more moderate approach by demanding constitutional protection of slavery.\\n JOHN BROWN\\nIn October 1859, the radical abolitionist John Brown and eighteen armed men, both Black and White, attacked the federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia. They hoped to capture the weapons there and distribute them among enslaved people to begin a massive uprising that would bring an end to slavery. Brown had already demonstrated during the 1856 Pottawatomie attack in Kansas that he had no patience for the nonviolent approach preached by pacifist abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison. Born in Connecticut in 1800, Brown (Figure 14.18) spent much of his life in the North, moving from Ohio to Pennsylvania and then upstate New York as his various business ventures failed. To him, slavery appeared an unacceptable evil that must be purged from the land, and like his Puritan forebears, he believed in using the sword to defeat the ungodly.\\n A photograph of John Brown is shown.\\n Figure 14.18 John Brown, shown here in a photograph from 1859, was a radical abolitionist who advocated the violent overthrow of slavery.\\n Brown had gone to Kansas in the 1850s in an effort to stop slavery, and there, he had perpetrated the killings at Pottawatomie. He told other abolitionists of his plan to take Harpers Ferry Armory and initiate a massive slave uprising. Some abolitionists provided financial support, while others, including Frederick Douglass, found the plot suicidal and refused to join. On October 16, 1859, Brown’s force easily took control of the federal armory, which was unguarded (Figure 14.19). However, his vision of a mass uprising failed completely. Very few enslaved people lived in the area to rally to Brown’s side, and the group found themselves holed up in the armory’s engine house with townspeople taking shots at them. Federal troops, commanded by Colonel Robert E. Lee, soon captured Brown and his followers. On December 2, Brown was hanged by the state of Virginia for treason.\\n An illustration shows John Brown and others with rifles and pikes, holding a small group of men hostage inside the engine house of Harpers Ferry Armory. Several other men lie injured on the ground. The caption reads “Harper’s Ferry insurrection—Interior of the Engine-House, just before the gate is broken down by the storming party—Col. Washington and his associates as captives, held by Brown as hostages.”\\n</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Figure 14.19 John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry represented the radical abolitionist’s attempt to start a revolt that would ultimately end slavery. This 1859 illustration, captioned “Harper’s Ferry insurrection—Interior of the Engine-House, just before the gate is broken down by the storming party—Col. Washington and his associates as captives, held by Brown as hostages,” is from Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Magazine. Do you think this image represents a southern or northern version of the raid? How are the characters in the scene depicted?\\nCLICK AND EXPLORE\\nVisit the Avalon Project on Yale Law School’s website to read the impassioned speech that Henry David Thoreau delivered on October 30, 1859, arguing against the execution of John Brown. How does Thoreau characterize Brown? What does he ask of his fellow citizens?\\n John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry generated intense reactions in both the South and the North. Southerners grew especially apprehensive of the possibility of other violent plots. They viewed Brown as a terrorist bent on destroying their civilization, and support for secession grew. Their anxiety led several southern states to pass laws designed to prevent rebellions by the enslaved. It seemed that the worst fears of the South had come true: A hostile majority would stop at nothing to destroy slavery. Was it possible, one resident of Maryland asked, to “live under a government, a majority of whose subjects or citizens regard John Brown as a martyr and Christian hero?” Many antislavery northerners did in fact consider Brown a martyr to the cause, and those who viewed slavery as a sin saw easy comparisons between him and Jesus Christ.\\n THE ELECTION OF 1860\\nThe election of 1860 threatened American democracy when the elevation of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency inspired secessionists in the South to withdraw their states from the Union.\\n Lincoln’s election owed much to the disarray in the Democratic Party. The Dred Scott decision and the Freeport Doctrine had opened up huge sectional divisions among Democrats. Though Brown did not intend it, his raid had furthered the split between northern and southern Democrats. Fire-Eaters vowed to prevent a northern Democrat, especially Illinois’s Stephen Douglas, from becoming their presidential candidate. These proslavery zealots insisted on a southern Democrat.\\n The Democratic nominating convention met in April 1860 in Charleston, South Carolina. However, it broke up after northern Democrats, who made up a majority of delegates, rejected Jefferson Davis’s efforts to protect slavery in the territories. These northern Democratic delegates knew that supporting Davis on this issue would be very unpopular among the people in their states. A second conference, held in Baltimore, further illustrated the divide within the Democratic Party. Northern Democrats nominated Stephen Douglas, while southern Democrats, who met separately, put forward Vice President John Breckinridge from Kentucky. The Democratic Party had fractured into two competing sectional factions.\\n By offering two candidates for president, the Democrats gave the Republicans an enormous advantage. Also hoping to prevent a Republican victory, pro-Unionists from the border states organized the Constitutional Union Party and put up a fourth candidate, John Bell, for president, who pledged to end slavery agitation and preserve the Union but never fully explained how he’d accomplish this objective.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>In a pro-Lincoln political cartoon of the time (Figure 14.20), the presidential election is presented as a baseball game. Lincoln stands on home plate. A skunk raises its tail at the other candidates. Holding his nose, southern Democrat John Breckinridge holds a bat labeled “Slavery Extension” and declares “I guess I’d better leave for Kentucky, for I smell something strong around here, and begin to think, that we are completely skunk’d.”\\n A cartoon titled “The national game. Three ‘outs’ and one ‘run’” depicts a baseball game in which Lincoln has defeated John Bell, Stephen A. Douglas, and John C. Breckinridge. Lincoln, with his foot on “Home Base,” says, “Gentlemen, if any of you should ever take a hand in another match at this game, remember that you must have a good bat and strike a fair ball to make a clean score and a home run.’ “ Lincoln’s bat is a wooden rail labeled “Equal Rights and Free Territory,” and his belt is labeled “Wide Awake Club.” A skunk raises its tail at the other candidates. Breckinridge holds his nose and declares “I guess I’d better leave for Kentucky, for I smell something strong around here, and begin to think, that we are completely skunk’d.’” Breckinridge’s bat is labeled “Slavery Extension,” and his belt is labeled “Disunion Club.” John Bell says, “It appears to me very singular that we three should strike foul and be put out while old Abe made such a good lick.” Bell’s belt is labeled “Union Club,” and his bat is labeled “Fusion.” Douglas, who holds a bat labeled “Non Intervention,” replies, “That’s because he had that confounded rail, to strike with, I thought our fusion would be a short stop to his career.”\\n Figure 14.20 The national game. Three “outs” and one “run” (1860), by Currier and Ives, shows the two Democratic candidates and one Constitutional Union candidate who lost the 1860 election to Republican Lincoln, shown at right.\\n The Republicans nominated Lincoln, and in the November election, he garnered a mere 40 percent of the popular vote, though he won every northern state except New Jersey. (Lincoln’s name was blocked from even appearing on many southern states’ ballots by southern Democrats.) More importantly, Lincoln did gain a majority in the Electoral College (Figure 14.21). The Fire-Eaters, however, refused to accept the results. With South Carolina leading the way, Fire-Eaters in southern states began to withdraw formally from the United States in 1860. South Carolinian Mary Boykin Chesnut wrote in her diary about the reaction to the Lincoln’s election. “Now that the Black radical Republicans have the power,” she wrote, “I suppose they will Brown us all.” Her statement revealed many southerners’ fear that with Lincoln as President, the South could expect more mayhem like the John Brown raid.\\n A map shows the disposition of electoral votes for the election of 1860.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>Each state is labeled to indicate the number of electoral votes cast and shaded to indicate the candidate to whom that state went. Oregon (3), California (4), Minnesota (4), Iowa (4), Wisconsin (5), Illinois (11), Indiana (13), Michigan (6), Ohio (23), Pennsylvania (27), New York (35), Connecticut (6), Rhode Island (4), Massachusetts (13), Vermont (5), New Hampshire (5), and Maine (8) voted for Lincoln. New Jersey, with seven votes total, voted for Lincoln with a majority of 4 votes and Douglas with 3. Texas (4), Louisiana (6), Arkansas (4), Mississippi (7), Alabama (9), Georgia (10), Florida (3), South Carolina (8), and North Carolina (10) voted for Breckinridge. Tennessee (12), Kentucky (12), and Virginia (15) voted for Bell. Missouri (9) voted for Douglas. The territories, which did not participate in the election, are labeled as well.\\n Figure 14.21 This map shows the disposition of electoral votes for the election of 1860.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nExplain the changes brought by the Protestant Reformation and how it influenced the development of the Atlantic World\\nDescribe Spain’s response to the Protestant Reformation\\nUntil the 1500s, the Catholic Church provided a unifying religious structure for Christian Europe. The Vatican in Rome exercised great power over the lives of Europeans; it controlled not only learning and scholarship but also finances, because it levied taxes on the faithful. Spain, with its New World wealth, was the bastion of the Catholic faith. Beginning with the reform efforts of Martin Luther in 1517 and John Calvin in the 1530s, however, Catholic dominance came under attack as the Protestant Reformation, a split or schism among European Christians, began.\\n During the sixteenth century, Protestantism spread through northern Europe, and Catholic countries responded by attempting to extinguish what was seen as the Protestant menace. Religious turmoil between Catholics and Protestants influenced the history of the Atlantic World as well, since different nation-states competed not only for control of new territories but also for the preeminence of their religious beliefs there. Just as the history of Spain’s rise to power is linked to the Reconquista, so too is the history of early globalization connected to the history of competing Christian groups in the Atlantic World.\\n MARTIN LUTHER\\nMartin Luther (Figure 2.8) was a German Catholic monk who took issue with the Catholic Church’s practice of selling indulgences, documents that absolved sinners of their errant behavior. He also objected to the Catholic Church’s taxation of ordinary Germans and the delivery of Mass in Latin, arguing that it failed to instruct German Catholics, who did not understand the language.\\n A painting depicts Martin Luther.\\n Figure 2.8 Martin Luther, a German Catholic monk and leader of the Protestant Reformation, was a close friend of the German painter Lucas Cranach the Elder. Cranach painted this and several other portraits of Luther.\\n Many Europeans had called for reforms of the Catholic Church before Martin Luther did, but his protest had the unintended consequence of splitting European Christianity. Luther compiled a list of what he viewed as needed Church reforms, a document that came to be known as The Ninety-Five Theses, and nailed it to the door of a church in Wittenberg, Germany, in 1517. He called for the publication of the Bible in everyday language, took issue with the Church’s policy of imposing tithes (a required payment to the Church that appeared to enrich the clergy), and denounced the buying and selling of indulgences. Although he had hoped to reform the Catholic Church while remaining a part of it, Luther’s action instead triggered a movement called the Protestant Reformation that divided the Church in two. The Catholic Church condemned him as a heretic, but a doctrine based on his reforms, called Lutheranism, spread through northern Germany and Scandinavia.\\nCLICK AND EXPLORE\\nVisit Fordham University’s Internet Medieval Sourcebook for access to many primary sources relating to the Protestant Reformation.\\n JOHN CALVIN\\nLike Luther, the French lawyer John Calvin advocated making the Bible accessible to ordinary people; only by reading scripture and reflecting daily about their spiritual condition, he argued, could believers begin to understand the power of God.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>In 1535, Calvin fled Catholic France and led the Reformation movement from Geneva, Switzerland.\\n Calvinism emphasized human powerlessness before an omniscient God and stressed the idea of predestination, the belief that God selected a few chosen people for salvation while everyone else was predestined to damnation. Calvinists believed that reading scripture prepared sinners, if they were among the elect, to receive God’s grace. In Geneva, Calvin established a Bible commonwealth, a community of believers whose sole source of authority was their interpretation of the Bible, not the authority of any prince or monarch. Soon Calvin’s ideas spread to the Netherlands and Scotland.\\n PROTESTANTISM IN ENGLAND\\nProtestantism spread beyond the German states and Geneva to England, which had been a Catholic nation for centuries. Luther’s idea that scripture should be available in the everyday language of worshippers inspired English scholar William Tyndale to translate the Bible into English in 1526. The seismic break with the Catholic Church in England occurred in the 1530s, when Henry VIII established a new, Protestant state religion.\\n A devout Catholic, Henry had initially stood in opposition to the Reformation. Pope Leo X even awarded him the title “Defender of the Faith.” The tides turned, however, when Henry desired a male heir to the Tudor monarchy. When his Spanish Catholic wife, Catherine (the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella), did not give birth to a boy, the king sought an annulment to their marriage. When the Pope refused his request, Henry created a new national Protestant church, the Church of England, with himself at its head. This left him free to annul his own marriage and marry Anne Boleyn.\\n Anne Boleyn also failed to produce a male heir, and when she was accused of adultery, Henry had her executed. His third wife, Jane Seymour, at long last delivered a son, Edward, who ruled for only a short time before dying in 1553 at the age of fifteen. Mary, the daughter of Henry VIII and his discarded first wife Catherine, then came to the throne, committed to restoring Catholicism. She earned the nickname “Bloody Mary” for the many executions of Protestants, often by burning alive, that she ordered during her reign.\\n Religious turbulence in England was finally quieted when Elizabeth, the Protestant daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, ascended the throne in 1558. Under Elizabeth, the Church of England again became the state church, retaining the hierarchical structure and many of the rituals of the Catholic Church. However, by the late 1500s, some English members of the Church began to agitate for more reform. Known as Puritans, they worked to erase all vestiges of Catholicism from the Church of England. At the time, the term “puritan” was a pejorative one; many people saw Puritans as holier-than-thou frauds who used religion to swindle their neighbors. Worse still, many in power saw Puritans as a security threat because of their opposition to the national church.\\n Under Elizabeth, whose long reign lasted from 1558 to 1603, Puritans grew steadily in number. After James I died in 1625 and his son Charles I ascended the throne, Puritans became the target of increasing state pressure to conform.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Many crossed the Atlantic in the 1620s and 1630s instead to create a New England, a haven for reformed Protestantism where Puritan was no longer a term of abuse. Thus, the religious upheavals that affected England so much had equally momentous consequences for the Americas.\\n RELIGIOUS WAR\\nBy the early 1500s, the Protestant Reformation threatened the massive Spanish Catholic empire. As the preeminent Catholic power, Spain would not tolerate any challenge to the Holy Catholic Church. Over the course of the 1500s, it devoted vast amounts of treasure and labor to leading an unsuccessful effort to eradicate Protestantism in Europe.\\n Spain’s main enemies at this time were the runaway Spanish provinces of the North Netherlands. By 1581, these seven northern provinces had declared their independence from Spain and created the Dutch Republic, also called Holland, where Protestantism was tolerated. Determined to deal a death blow to Protestantism in England and Holland, King Philip of Spain assembled a massive force of over thirty thousand men and 130 ships, and in 1588 he sent this navy, the Spanish Armada, north. But English sea power combined with a maritime storm destroyed the fleet.\\n The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 was but one part of a larger but undeclared war between Protestant England and Catholic Spain. Between 1585 and 1604, the two rivals sparred repeatedly. England launched its own armada in 1589 in an effort to disable the Spanish fleet and capture Spanish treasure. However, the foray ended in disaster for the English, with storms, disease, and the strength of the Spanish Armada combining to bring about defeat.\\n The conflict between Spain and England dragged on into the early seventeenth century, and the newly Protestant nations, especially England and the Dutch Republic, posed a significant challenge to Spain (and also to Catholic France) as imperial rivalries played out in the Atlantic World. Spain retained its mighty American empire, but by the early 1600s, the nation could no longer keep England and other European rivals—the French and Dutch—from colonizing smaller islands in the Caribbean (Figure 2.9).\\n A portrait of Elizabeth I shows the queen in full regalia with her hand on a globe. Behind her, through the windows, scenes showing the defeat of the Spanish Armada are visible.\\n Figure 2.9 This portrait of Elizabeth I of England, painted by George Gower in about 1588, shows Elizabeth with her hand on a globe, signifying her power over the world. The pictures in the background show the English defeat of the Spanish Armada.\\n Religious intolerance characterized the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, an age of powerful state religions with the authority to impose and enforce belief systems on the population. In this climate, religious violence was common. One of the most striking examples is the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre of 1572, in which French Catholic troops began to kill unarmed French Protestants (Figure 2.10). The murders touched off mob violence that ultimately claimed nine thousand lives, a bloody episode that highlights the degree of religious turmoil that gripped Europe in the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation.\\n A painting shows French Catholic troops slaughtering French Protestant Calvinists in the streets of Paris.\\n Figure 2.10 Saint Bartholomew’s Day Massacre (1772-84), by François Dubois, shows the horrific violence of the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre. In this scene, French Catholic troops slaughter French Protestant Calvinists.</chunk3>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors.

If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nExplain the reasons for the rise of slavery in the American colonies\\nDescribe changes to Native life, including warfare and hunting\\nContrast European and Native American views on property\\nAssess the impact of European settlement on the environment\\nAs Europeans moved beyond exploration and into colonization of the Americas, they brought changes to virtually every aspect of the land and its people, from trade and hunting to warfare and personal property. European goods, ideas, and diseases shaped the changing continent.\\n As Europeans established their colonies, their societies also became segmented and divided along religious and racial lines. Most people in these societies were not free; they labored as servants or enslaved people, doing the work required to produce wealth for others. By 1700, the American continent had become a place of stark contrasts between slavery and freedom, between the haves and the have-nots.\\n THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY\\nEverywhere in the American colonies, a crushing demand for labor existed to grow New World cash crops, especially sugar and tobacco. This need led Europeans to rely increasingly on Africans, and after 1600, the movement of Africans across the Atlantic accelerated. The English crown chartered the Royal African Company in 1672, giving the company a monopoly over the transport of enslaved African people to the English colonies. Over the next four decades, the company transported around 350,000 Africans from their homelands. By 1700, the tiny English sugar island of Barbados had a population of fifty thousand enslaved people, and the English had encoded the institution of chattel slavery into colonial law.\\n This new system of African slavery came slowly to the English colonists, who did not have slavery at home and preferred to use servant labor. Nevertheless, by the end of the seventeenth century, the English everywhere in America—and particularly in the Chesapeake Bay colonies—had come to rely on enslaved Africans. While Africans had long practiced slavery among their own people, it had not been based on race. Africans enslaved other Africans as war captives, for crimes, and to settle debts; they generally used enslaved people for domestic and small-scale agricultural work, not for growing cash crops on large plantations. Additionally, African slavery was often a temporary condition rather than a lifelong sentence, and, unlike New World slavery, it was typically not heritable (passed from an enslaved mother to her children).\\n The growing slave trade with Europeans had a profound impact on the people of West Africa, giving prominence to local chieftains and merchants who traded enslaved people for European textiles, alcohol, guns, tobacco, and food. Africans also charged Europeans for the right to trade in enslaved people and imposed taxes on enslaved people purchases. Different African groups and kingdoms even staged large-scale raids on each other to meet the demand for enslaved people.\\n Once sold to traders, all captured people sent to America endured the hellish Middle Passage, the transatlantic crossing, which took one to two months. By 1625, more than 325,800 Africans had been shipped to the New World, though many thousands perished during the voyage.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>An astonishing number, some four million, were transported to the Caribbean between 1501 and 1830. When they reached their destination in America, Africans found themselves trapped in shockingly brutal slave societies. In the Chesapeake colonies, they faced a lifetime of harvesting and processing tobacco.\\n Everywhere, Africans resisted slavery, and running away was common. In Jamaica and elsewhere, escaped enslaved people created maroon communities, groups that resisted recapture and eked out a living from the land, rebuilding their communities as best they could. When possible, they adhered to traditional ways, following spiritual leaders such as Vodun priests.\\n CHANGES TO NATIVE LIFE\\nWhile the Americas remained firmly under the control of native peoples in the first decades of European settlement, conflict increased as colonization spread and Europeans placed greater demands upon the native populations, including expecting them to convert to Christianity (either Catholicism or Protestantism). Throughout the seventeenth century, the still-powerful native peoples and confederacies that retained control of the land waged war against the invading Europeans, achieving a degree of success in their effort to drive the newcomers from the continent.\\n At the same time, European goods had begun to change Native life radically. In the 1500s, some of the earliest objects Europeans introduced to Native Americans were glass beads, copper kettles, and metal utensils. Native people often adapted these items for their own use. For example, some cut up copper kettles and refashioned the metal for other uses, including jewelry that conferred status on the wearer, who was seen as connected to the new European source of raw materials.\\n As European settlements grew throughout the 1600s, European goods flooded Native communities. Soon Native people were using these items for the same purposes as the Europeans. For example, many Native inhabitants abandoned their animal-skin clothing in favor of European textiles. Similarly, clay cookware gave way to metal cooking implements, and Native Americans found that European flint and steel made starting fires much easier (Figure 3.15).\\n A 1681 painting depicts Niantic-Narragansett chief Ninigret. He wears what appear to be animal-skin footwear and loincloth, along with a patterned fabric headband, a fabric cloak, and a necklace that includes a round metallic piece.\\n Figure 3.15 In this 1681 portrait, the Niantic-Narragansett leader Ninigret wears a combination of European and Native American goods. Which elements of each culture are evident in this portrait?\\n The abundance of European goods gave rise to new artistic objects. For example, iron awls made the creation of shell beads among the native people of the Eastern Woodlands much easier, and the result was an astonishing increase in the production of wampum, shell beads used in ceremonies and as jewelry and currency. Native peoples had always placed goods in the graves of their departed, and this practice escalated with the arrival of European goods. Archaeologists have found enormous caches of European trade goods in the graves of Native Americans on the East Coast.\\n Native weapons changed dramatically as well, creating an arms race among the peoples living in European colonization zones. Native Americans refashioned European brassware into arrow points and turned axes used for chopping wood into weapons.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>The most prized piece of European weaponry to obtain was a musket, or light, long-barreled European gun. In order to trade with Europeans for these, Native peoples intensified their harvesting of beaver, commercializing their traditional practice.\\n The influx of European materials made warfare more lethal and changed traditional patterns of authority among tribes. Formerly weaker groups, if they had access to European metal and weapons, suddenly gained the upper hand against once-dominant groups. The Algonquian, for instance, traded with the French for muskets and gained power against their enemies, the Iroquois. Eventually, native peoples also used their new weapons against the European colonizers who had provided them.\\n CLICK AND EXPLORE\\nExplore the complexity of Native-European relationships in the series of primary source documents on the National Humanities Center site.\\n ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES\\nThe European presence in America spurred countless changes in the environment, setting into motion chains of events that affected native animals as well as people. The popularity of beaver-trimmed hats in Europe, coupled with Native American’s desire for European weapons, led to the overhunting of beaver in the Northeast. Soon, beavers were extinct in New England, New York, and other areas. With their loss came the loss of beaver ponds, which had served as habitats for fish as well as water sources for deer, moose, and other animals. Furthermore, Europeans introduced pigs, which they allowed to forage in forests and other wildlands. Pigs consumed the foods on which deer and other indigenous species depended, resulting in scarcity of the game native peoples had traditionally hunted.\\n European ideas about owning land as private property clashed with natives’ understanding of land use. Native peoples did not believe in private ownership of land; instead, they viewed land as a resource to be held in common for the benefit of the group. The European idea of usufruct—the right to common land use and enjoyment—comes close to the native understanding, but colonists did not practice usufruct widely in America. Colonizers established fields, fences, and other means of demarcating private property. Native peoples who moved seasonally to take advantage of natural resources now found areas off limits, claimed by colonizers because of their insistence on private-property rights.\\n The Introduction of Disease\\nPerhaps European colonization’s single greatest impact on the North American environment was the introduction of disease. Microbes to which native inhabitants had no immunity led to death everywhere Europeans settled. Along the New England coast between 1616 and 1618, epidemics claimed the lives of 75 percent of the native people. In the 1630s, half the Huron and Iroquois around the Great Lakes died of smallpox. As is often the case with disease, the very young and the very old were the most vulnerable and had the highest mortality rates. The loss of the older generation meant the loss of knowledge and tradition, while the death of children only compounded the trauma, creating devastating implications for future generations.\\n Some native peoples perceived disease as a weapon used by hostile spiritual forces, and they went to war to exorcise the disease from their midst. These “mourning wars” in eastern North America were designed to gain captives who would either be adopted (“requickened” as a replacement for a deceased loved one) or ritually tortured and executed to assuage the anger and grief caused by loss.\\n</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>The Cultivation of Plants\\nEuropean expansion in the Americas led to an unprecedented movement of plants across the Atlantic. A prime example is tobacco, which became a valuable export as the habit of smoking, previously unknown in Europe, took hold (Figure 3.16). Another example is sugar. Columbus brought sugarcane to the Caribbean on his second voyage in 1494, and thereafter a wide variety of other herbs, flowers, seeds, and roots made the transatlantic voyage.\\n A 1646 Dutch painting depicts a man seated at a table smoking a long white clay pipe with evident enjoyment.\\n Figure 3.16 Adriaen van Ostade, a Dutch artist, painted An Apothecary Smoking in an Interior in 1646. The large European market for American tobacco strongly influenced the development of some of the American colonies.\\n Just as pharmaceutical companies today scour the natural world for new drugs, Europeans traveled to America to discover new medicines. The task of cataloging the new plants found there helped give birth to the science of botany. Early botanists included the English naturalist Sir Hans Sloane, who traveled to Jamaica in 1687 and there recorded hundreds of new plants (Figure 3.17). Sloane also helped popularize the drinking of chocolate, made from the cacao bean, in England.\\n The cover of Sir Hans Sloane’s catalog of the flora of the New World is shown. The title begins, “Voyage to the Islands Madera, Barbadoes, Nieves, St. Christophers, and Jamaica; with the Natural History of the Herbs and Trees, Four-footed Beasts, Fishes, Birds, Insects, Reptiles, &c., Of the last of those Islands.”\\n Figure 3.17 English naturalist Sir Hans Sloane traveled to Jamaica and other Caribbean islands to catalog the flora of the new world.\\n Native Americans, who possessed a vast understanding of local New World plants and their properties, would have been a rich source of information for those European botanists seeking to find and catalog potentially useful plants. Enslaved Africans, who had a tradition of the use of medicinal plants in their native land, adapted to their new surroundings by learning the use of New World plants through experimentation or from the native inhabitants. Native peoples and Africans employed their knowledge effectively within their own communities. One notable example was the use of the peacock flower to induce abortions: Native American and enslaved African women living in oppressive colonial regimes are said to have used this herb to prevent the birth of children into slavery. Europeans distrusted medical knowledge that came from African or native sources, however, and thus lost the benefit of this source of information.</chunk4>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags. The answer should contain the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D) and the text of the correct answer. Example:\\n<ANSWER>A) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.</ANSWER>\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\nEuropean colonization of the Americas resulted in significant changes in trade, culture, and society, introducing new goods and ideas while stratifying communities along religious and racial lines.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nAnalyze the role slavery played in the history and economy of the British Empire\\nExplain the effects of the 1739 Stono Rebellion and the 1741 New York Conspiracy Trials\\nDescribe the consumer revolution and its effect on the life of the colonial gentry and other settlers\\nSlavery formed a cornerstone of the British Empire in the eighteenth century. Every colony had enslaved people, from the southern rice plantations in Charles Town, South Carolina, to the northern wharves of Boston. Slavery was more than a labor system; it also influenced every aspect of colonial thought and culture. The uneven relationship it engendered gave White colonists an exaggerated sense of their own status. English liberty gained greater meaning and coherence for White people when they contrasted their status to that of the unfree class of enslaved Black people in British America. African slavery provided White colonists with a shared racial bond and identity.\\n SLAVERY AND THE STONO REBELLION\\n The transport of captured Africans to the American colonies accelerated in the second half of the seventeenth century. In 1660, Charles II created the Royal African Company (Figure 4.9) to trade in African goods and enslaved people.. His brother, James II, led the company before ascending the throne. Under both these kings, the Royal African Company had a monopoly on the slave trade to the English colonies. Between 1672 and 1713, the company bought 125,000 captives on the African coast, losing 20 percent of them to death on the Middle Passage, the journey from the African coast to the Americas.\\n The front and back of an English guinea are shown. The front of the coin shows a bust of King James II with an elephant and castle logo beneath.\\n Figure 4.9 The 1686 English guinea shows the logo of the Royal African Company, an elephant and castle, beneath a bust of King James II. The coins were commonly called guineas because most British gold came from Guinea in West Africa.\\n The Royal African Company’s monopoly ended in 1689 as a result of the Glorious Revolution. After that date, many more English merchants engaged in the slave trade, greatly increasing the number of captives being transported. Africans who survived the brutal Middle Passage usually arrived in the West Indies, often in Barbados. From there, they were transported to the mainland English colonies on company ships. While merchants in London, Bristol, and Liverpool lined their pockets, Africans trafficked by the company endured a nightmare of misery, privation, and dislocation.\\n Enslaved Africans strove to adapt to their new lives by forming new communities among themselves, often adhering to traditional African customs and healing techniques. Indeed, the development of families and communities formed the most important response to the trauma of being enslaved. Others dealt with the trauma of their situation by actively resisting their condition, whether by defying their captors or running away. Escaped enslaved people formed what were called “maroon” communities, groups that successfully resisted recapture and formed their own autonomous groups. The most prominent of these communities lived in the interior of Jamaica, controlling the area and keeping the British away.\\n</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Enslaved people everywhere resisted their exploitation and attempted to gain freedom. They fully understood that rebellions would bring about massive retaliation from White people and therefore had little chance of success. Even so, rebellions occurred frequently. One notable uprising that became known as the Stono Rebellion took place in South Carolina in September 1739. A literate Angolan named Jemmy led a large group of captive Africans in an armed insurrection against White colonists. The militia suppressed the rebellion after a battle in which both enslaved people and militiamen were killed, and the remaining rebels were executed or sold to enslavers in the West Indies.\\n Jemmy is believed to have been taken from the Kingdom of Kongo, an area where the Portuguese had introduced Catholicism. Other enslaved people in South Carolina may have had a similar background: Africa-born and familiar with White people. If so, this common background may have made it easier for Jemmy to communicate with the other rebels, enabling them to work together to resist their enslavement even though enslavers labored to keep their captives from forging such communities.\\n In the wake of the Stono Rebellion, South Carolina passed a new slave code in 1740 called An Act for the Better Ordering and Governing of Negroes and Other Slaves in the Province, also known as the Negro Act of 1740. This law imposed new limits on enslaved people’s behavior, prohibiting them from assembling, growing their own food, learning to write, and traveling freely.\\n THE NEW YORK CONSPIRACY TRIALS OF 1741\\nEighteenth-century New York City contained many different ethnic groups, and conflicts among them created strain. In addition, one in five New Yorkers was an enslaved person, and tensions ran high between the enslaved and the free population, especially in the aftermath of the Stono Rebellion. These tensions burst forth in 1741.\\n That year, thirteen fires broke out in the city, one of which reduced the colony’s Fort George to ashes. Ever fearful of an uprising among enslaved New Yorkers, the city’s White residents spread rumors that the fires were part of a massive revolt in which enslaved people would murder White people, burn the city, and take over the colony. The Stono Rebellion was only a few years in the past, and throughout British America, fears of similar incidents were still fresh. Searching for solutions, and convinced their captives were the principal danger, nervous British authorities interrogated almost two hundred enslaved people and accused them of conspiracy. Rumors that Roman Catholics had joined the suspected conspiracy and planned to murder Protestant inhabitants of the city only added to the general hysteria. Very quickly, two hundred people were arrested, including a large number of the city’s enslaved population.\\n After a quick series of trials at City Hall, known as the New York Conspiracy Trials of 1741, the government executed seventeen New Yorkers. Thirteen Black men were publicly burned at the stake, while the others (including four White men) were hanged (Figure 4.10). Seventy people were sold to the West Indies. Little evidence exists to prove that an elaborate conspiracy, like the one White New Yorkers imagined, actually existed.\\n An illustration shows a Black man tied to a stake with kindling aflame at his feet; White soldiers holding guns push back a watching crowd.\\n</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Figure 4.10 In the wake of a series of fires throughout New York City, rumors of a slave revolt led authorities to convict and execute thirty people, including thirteen Black men who were publicly burned at the stake.\\n The events of 1741 in New York City illustrate the racial divide in British America, where panic among White people spurred great violence against and repression of the feared enslaved population. In the end, the Conspiracy Trials furthered White dominance and power over enslaved New Yorkers.\\n CLICK AND EXPLORE\\nRead excerpts from the testimony given during the New York Conspiracy Trials of 1741 at History Matters to learn more about the hysteria that gripped New York in 1741.\\n COLONIAL GENTRY AND THE CONSUMER REVOLUTION\\nBritish Americans’ reliance on indentured servitude and slavery to meet the demand for colonial labor helped give rise to a wealthy colonial class—the gentry—in the Chesapeake tobacco colonies and elsewhere. To be “genteel,” that is, a member of the gentry, meant to be refined, free of all rudeness. The British American gentry modeled themselves on the English aristocracy, who embodied the ideal of refinement and gentility. They built elaborate mansions to advertise their status and power. William Byrd II of Westover, Virginia, exemplifies the colonial gentry; a wealthy planter and slaveholder, he is known for founding Richmond and for his diaries documenting the life of a gentleman planter (Figure 4.11).\\n A painted portrait shows William Byrd II posing with an elbow on a mantelpiece.\\n Figure 4.11 This painting by Hans Hysing, ca. 1724, depicts William Byrd II. Byrd was a wealthy gentleman planter in Virginia and a member of the colonial gentry.\\n One of the ways in which the gentry set themselves apart from others was through their purchase, consumption, and display of goods. An increased supply of consumer goods from England that became available in the eighteenth century led to a phenomenon called the consumer revolution. These products linked the colonies to Great Britain in real and tangible ways. Indeed, along with the colonial gentry, ordinary settlers in the colonies also participated in the frenzy of consumer spending on goods from Great Britain. Tea, for example, came to be regarded as the drink of the Empire, with or without fashionable tea sets.\\n The consumer revolution also made printed materials more widely available. Before 1680, for instance, no newspapers had been printed in colonial America. In the eighteenth century, however, a flood of journals, books, pamphlets, and other publications became available to readers on both sides of the Atlantic. This shared trove of printed matter linked members of the Empire by creating a community of shared tastes and ideas.\\n Cato’s Letters, by Englishmen John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, was one popular series of 144 pamphlets. These Whig circulars were published between 1720 and 1723 and emphasized the glory of England, especially its commitment to liberty. However, the pamphlets cautioned readers to be ever vigilant and on the lookout for attacks upon that liberty. Indeed, Cato’s Letters suggested that there were constant efforts to undermine and destroy it.\\n Another very popular publication was the English gentlemen’s magazine the Spectator, published between 1711 and 1714.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>In each issue, “Mr. Spectator” observed and commented on the world around him. What made the Spectator so wildly popular was its style; the essays were meant to persuade, and to cultivate among readers a refined set of behaviors, rejecting deceit and intolerance and focusing instead on the polishing of genteel taste and manners.\\n Novels, a new type of literature, made their first appearance in the eighteenth century and proved very popular in the British Atlantic. Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe and Samuel Richardson’s Pamela: Or, Virtue Rewarded found large and receptive audiences. Reading also allowed female readers the opportunity to interpret what they read without depending on a male authority to tell them what to think. Few women beyond the colonial gentry, however, had access to novels.</chunk4>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags.

Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nExplain the significance of the Great Awakening\\nDescribe the genesis, central ideas, and effects of the Enlightenment in British North America\\nTwo major cultural movements further strengthened Anglo-American colonists’ connection to Great Britain: the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment. Both movements began in Europe, but they advocated very different ideas: the Great Awakening promoted a fervent, emotional religiosity, while the Enlightenment encouraged the pursuit of reason in all things. On both sides of the Atlantic, British subjects grappled with these new ideas.\\n THE FIRST GREAT AWAKENING\\nDuring the eighteenth century, the British Atlantic experienced an outburst of Protestant revivalism known as the First Great Awakening. (A Second Great Awakening would take place in the 1800s.) During the First Great Awakening, evangelists came from the ranks of several Protestant denominations: Congregationalists, Anglicans (members of the Church of England), and Presbyterians. They rejected what appeared to be sterile, formal modes of worship in favor of a vigorous emotional religiosity. Whereas Martin Luther and John Calvin had preached a doctrine of predestination and close reading of scripture, new evangelical ministers spread a message of personal and experiential faith that rose above mere book learning. Individuals could bring about their own salvation by accepting Christ, an especially welcome message for those who had felt excluded by traditional Protestantism: women, the young, and people at the lower end of the social spectrum.\\n The Great Awakening caused a split between those who followed the evangelical message (the “New Lights”) and those who rejected it (the “Old Lights”). The elite ministers in British America were firmly Old Lights, and they censured the new revivalism as chaos. Indeed, the revivals did sometimes lead to excess. In one notorious incident in 1743, an influential New Light minister named James Davenport urged his listeners to burn books. The next day, he told them to burn their clothes as a sign of their casting off the sinful trappings of the world. He then took off his own pants and threw them into the fire, but a woman saved them and tossed them back to Davenport, telling him he had gone too far.\\n Another outburst of Protestant revivalism began in New Jersey, led by a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church named Theodorus Frelinghuysen. Frelinghuysen’s example inspired other ministers, including Gilbert Tennent, a Presbyterian. Tennant helped to spark a Presbyterian revival in the Middle Colonies (Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey), in part by founding a seminary to train other evangelical clergyman. New Lights also founded colleges in Rhode Island and New Hampshire that would later become Brown University and Dartmouth College.\\n In Northampton, Massachusetts, Jonathan Edwards led still another explosion of evangelical fervor. Edwards had grown frustrated with lack of religious emotion among practicing Christians within his community. He wanted to enliven religious practice. An important component of his approach involved using vivid depictions of the terrors of hell (Figure 4.13). Edward's best-known sermon, “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,” perfectly exemplifies this terrifying approach.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>One passage reads: “The wrath of God burns against them [sinners], their damnation don’t slumber, the pit is prepared, the fire is made ready, the furnace is now hot, ready to receive them, the flames do now rage and glow. The glittering sword is whet, and held over them, and the pit hath opened her mouth under them.” Edwards’s revival spread along the Connecticut River Valley, and news of the event spread rapidly through the frequent reprinting of his famous sermon.\\n The frontispiece of Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, A Sermon Preached at Enfield, July 8, 1741 is shown.\\n Figure 4.13 This image shows the frontispiece of Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, A Sermon Preached at Enfield, July 8, 1741 by Jonathan Edwards. Edwards was an evangelical preacher who led a Protestant revival in New England. This was his most famous sermon, the text of which was reprinted often and distributed widely.\\n The foremost evangelical of the Great Awakening was an Anglican minister named George Whitefield. Like many evangelical ministers, Whitefield was itinerant, traveling the countryside instead of having his own church and congregation. Between 1739 and 1740, he electrified colonial listeners with his brilliant oratory.\\n AMERICANA\\nTwo Opposing Views of George Whitefield\\nNot everyone embraced George Whitefield and other New Lights. Many established Old Lights decried the way the new evangelical religions appealed to people’s passions, rather than to traditional religious values. The two illustrations below present two very different visions of George Whitefield (Figure 4.14).\\n Illustration (a) shows George Whitefield preaching, with his hands raised and a neutral facial expression. Cartoon (b) shows George Whitefield preaching, again with his hands raised, surrounded by men and women; he is flanked from above by an angel on one side, a devil on the other. In the surrounding crowd, groups of men seem to be lecturing or harassing people; for example, in the far right corner two men are overturning the table of a woman, perhaps a vendor of some sort. The title reads “Dr. Squintum’s Exaltation or the Reformation.”\\n Figure 4.14 In the 1774 portrait of George Whitefield by engraver Elisha Gallaudet (a), Whitefield appears with a gentle expression on his face. Although his hands are raised in exultation or entreaty, he does not look particularly roused or rousing. In the 1763 British political cartoon to the right, “Dr. Squintum’s Exaltation or the Reformation” (b), Whitefield’s hands are raised in a similar position, but there the similarities end.\\n Compare the two images above. On the left is an illustration for Whitefield’s memoirs, while on the right is a cartoon satirizing the circus-like atmosphere that his preaching seemed to attract (Dr. Squintum was a nickname for Whitefield, who was cross-eyed). How do these two artists portray the same man? What emotions are the illustration for his memoirs intended to evoke? What details can you find in the cartoon that indicate the artist’s distaste for the preacher?\\n The Great Awakening saw the rise of several Protestant denominations, including Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists (who emphasized adult baptism of converted Christians rather than infant baptism).</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>These new churches gained converts and competed with older Protestant groups like Anglicans (members of the Church of England), Congregationalists (the heirs of Puritanism in America), and Quakers. The influence of these older Protestant groups, such as the New England Congregationalists, declined because of the Great Awakening. Nonetheless, the Great Awakening touched the lives of thousands on both sides of the Atlantic and provided a shared experience in the eighteenth-century British Empire.\\n THE ENLIGHTENMENT\\nThe Enlightenment, or the Age of Reason, was an intellectual and cultural movement in the eighteenth century that emphasized reason over superstition and science over blind faith. Using the power of the press, Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke, Isaac Newton, and Voltaire questioned accepted knowledge and spread new ideas about openness, investigation, and religious tolerance throughout Europe and the Americas. Many consider the Enlightenment a major turning point in Western civilization, an age of light replacing an age of darkness.\\n Several ideas dominated Enlightenment thought, including rationalism, empiricism, progressivism, and cosmopolitanism. Rationalism is the idea that humans are capable of using their faculty of reason to gain knowledge. This was a sharp turn away from the prevailing idea that people needed to rely on scripture or church authorities for knowledge. Empiricism promotes the idea that knowledge comes from experience and observation of the world. Progressivism is the belief that through their powers of reason and observation, humans could make unlimited, linear progress over time; this belief was especially important as a response to the carnage and upheaval of the English Civil Wars in the seventeenth century. Finally, cosmopolitanism reflected Enlightenment thinkers’ view of themselves as citizens of the world and actively engaged in it, as opposed to being provincial and close-minded. In all, Enlightenment thinkers endeavored to be ruled by reason, not prejudice.\\n The Freemasons were a fraternal society that advocated Enlightenment principles of inquiry and tolerance. Freemasonry originated in London coffeehouses in the early eighteenth century, and Masonic lodges (local units) soon spread throughout Europe and the British colonies. One prominent Freemason, Benjamin Franklin, stands as the embodiment of the Enlightenment in British America (Figure 4.15). Born in Boston in 1706 to a large Puritan family, Franklin loved to read, although he found little beyond religious publications in his father’s house. In 1718 he was apprenticed to his brother to work in a print shop, where he learned how to be a good writer by copying the style he found in the Spectator, which his brother printed. At the age of seventeen, the independent-minded Franklin ran away, eventually ending up in Quaker Philadelphia. There he began publishing the Pennsylvania Gazette in the late 1720s, and in 1732 he started his annual publication Poor Richard: An Almanack, in which he gave readers much practical advice, such as “Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.”\\n A portrait of Benjamin Franklin is shown.\\n Figure 4.15 In this 1748 portrait by Robert Feke, a forty-year-old Franklin wears a stylish British wig, as befitted a proud and loyal member of the British Empire.\\n</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>Franklin subscribed to deism, an Enlightenment-era belief in a God who created, but has no continuing involvement in, the world and the events within it. Deists also advanced the belief that personal morality—an individual’s moral compass, leading to good works and actions—is more important than strict church doctrines. Franklin’s deism guided his many philanthropic projects. In 1731, he established a reading library that became the Library Company of Philadelphia. In 1743, he founded the American Philosophical Society to encourage the spirit of inquiry. In 1749, he provided the foundation for the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1751, he helped found Pennsylvania Hospital.\\n His career as a printer made Franklin wealthy and well-respected. When he retired in 1748, he devoted himself to politics and scientific experiments. His most famous work, on electricity, exemplified Enlightenment principles. Franklin observed that lightning strikes tended to hit metal objects and reasoned that he could therefore direct lightning through the placement of metal objects during an electrical storm. He used this knowledge to advocate the use of lightning rods: metal poles connected to wires directing lightning’s electrical charge into the ground and saving wooden homes in cities like Philadelphia from catastrophic fires. He published his findings in 1751, in Experiments and Observations on Electricity.\\n Franklin also wrote of his “rags to riches” tale, his Memoir, in the 1770s and 1780s. This story laid the foundation for the American Dream of upward social mobility.\\n CLICK AND EXPLORE\\nVisit the media gallery for PBS’s Ken Burns Franklin documentary to watch excerpts covering some of Franklin's many achievements.\\n THE FOUNDING OF GEORGIA\\nThe reach of Enlightenment thought was both broad and deep. In the 1730s, it even prompted the founding of a new colony. Having witnessed the terrible conditions of debtors’ prison, as well as the results of releasing penniless debtors onto the streets of London, James Oglethorpe, a member of Parliament and advocate of social reform, petitioned King George II for a charter to start a new colony. George II, understanding the strategic advantage of a British colony standing as a buffer between South Carolina and Spanish Florida, granted the charter to Oglethorpe and twenty like-minded proprietors in 1732. Oglethorpe led the settlement of the colony, which was called Georgia in honor of the king. In 1733, he and 113 immigrants arrived on the ship Anne. Over the next decade, Parliament funded the migration of twenty-five hundred settlers, making Georgia the only government-funded colonial project.\\n Oglethorpe’s vision for Georgia followed the ideals of the Age of Reason, seeing it as a place for England’s “worthy poor” to start anew. To encourage industry, he gave each male immigrant fifty acres of land, tools, and a year’s worth of supplies. In Savannah, the Oglethorpe Plan provided for a utopia: “an agrarian model of sustenance while sustaining egalitarian values holding all men as equal.”\\nOglethorpe’s vision called for alcohol and slavery to be banned. However, colonists who relocated from other colonies, especially South Carolina, disregarded these prohibitions. Despite its proprietors’ early vision of a colony guided by Enlightenment ideals and free of slavery, by the 1750s, Georgia was producing quantities of rice grown and harvested by the enslaved.</chunk4>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags. The answer should contain the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D) and the text of the correct answer. Example:\\n<ANSWER>A) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.</ANSWER>\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"<text>\\nTwo major cultural movements that connected Anglo-American colonists to Great Britain were the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment, both originating from Europe.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text.

Great Britain fought four separate wars against Catholic France from the late 1600s to the mid-1700s. Another war, the War of Jenkins’ Ear, pitted Britain against Spain. These conflicts for control of North America also helped colonists forge important alliances with native peoples, as different tribes aligned themselves with different European powers.\\n GENERATIONS OF WARFARE\\nGenerations of British colonists grew up during a time when much of North America, especially the Northeast, engaged in war. Colonists knew war firsthand. In the eighteenth century, fighting was seasonal. Armies mobilized in the spring, fought in the summer, and retired to winter quarters in the fall. The British army imposed harsh discipline on its soldiers, who were drawn from the poorer classes, to ensure they did not step out of line during engagements. If they did, their officers would kill them. On the battlefield, armies dressed in bright uniforms to advertise their bravery and lack of fear. They stood in tight formation and exchanged volleys with the enemy. They often feared their officers more than the enemy.\\n CLICK AND EXPLORE\\nRead the diary of a provincial soldier who fought in the French and Indian War on the Captain David Perry Web Site hosted by Rootsweb. David Perry’s journal, which includes a description of the 1758 campaign, provides a glimpse of warfare in the eighteenth century.\\n Most imperial conflicts had both American and European fronts, leaving us with two names for each war. For instance, King William’s War (1688–1697) is also known as the War of the League of Augsburg. In America, the bulk of the fighting in this conflict took place between New England and New France. The war proved inconclusive, with no clear victor (Figure 4.16).\\n A map shows the campaigns of King William’s War, as well as the French- and British-held areas, missions, forts, and settlements.\\n Figure 4.16 This map shows the French and British armies’ movements during King William’s War, in which there was no clear victor.\\n Queen Anne’s War (1702–1713) is also known as the War of Spanish Succession. England fought against both Spain and France over who would ascend the Spanish throne after the last of the Habsburg rulers died. In North America, fighting took place in Florida, New England, and New France. In Canada, the French prevailed but lost Acadia and Newfoundland; however, the victory was again not decisive because the English failed to take Quebec, which would have given them control of Canada.\\n This conflict is best remembered in the United States for the French and Native raid against Deerfield, Massachusetts, in 1704. A small French force, combined with a native group made up of Catholic Mohawks and Abenaki (Pocumtucs), attacked the frontier outpost of Deerfield, killing scores and taking 112 prisoners. Among the captives was the seven-year-old daughter of Deerfield’s minister John Williams, named Eunice.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>She was held by the Mohawks for years as her family tried to get her back, and became assimilated into the tribe. To the horror of the Puritan leaders, when she grew up Eunice married a Mohawk and refused to return to New England.\\n In North America, possession of Georgia and trade with the interior was the focus of the War of Jenkins’ Ear (1739–1742), a conflict between Britain and Spain over contested claims to the land occupied by the fledgling colony between South Carolina and Florida. The war got its name from an incident in 1731 in which a Spanish Coast Guard captain severed the ear of British captain Robert Jenkins as punishment for raiding Spanish ships in Panama. Jenkins fueled the growing animosity between England and Spain by presenting his ear to Parliament and stirring up British public outrage. More than anything else, the War of Jenkins’ Ear disrupted the Atlantic trade, a situation that hurt both Spain and Britain and was a major reason the war came to a close in 1742. Georgia, founded six years earlier, remained British and a buffer against Spanish Florida.\\n King George’s War (1744–1748), known in Europe as the War of Austrian Succession (1740–1748), was fought in the northern colonies and New France. In 1745, the British took the massive French fortress at Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia (Figure 4.17). However, three years later, under the terms of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Britain relinquished control of the fortress to the French. Once again, war resulted in an incomplete victory for both Britain and France.\\n A painting shows British forces landing on the island of Cape Breton.\\n Figure 4.17 In this 1747 painting by J. Stevens, View of the landing of the New England forces in ye expedition against Cape Breton, British forces land on the island of Cape Breton to capture Fort Louisbourg.\\n THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR\\nThe final imperial war, the French and Indian War (1754–1763), known as the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) in Europe, proved to be the decisive contest between Britain and France in America. It began over rival claims along the frontier in present-day western Pennsylvania. Well-connected planters from Virginia faced stagnant tobacco prices and hoped expanding into these western lands would stabilize their wealth and status. Some of them established the Ohio Company of Virginia in 1748, and the British crown granted the company half a million acres in 1749. However, the French also claimed the lands of the Ohio Company, and to protect the region they established Fort Duquesne in 1754, where the Ohio, Monongahela, and Allegheny Rivers met.\\n The war began in May 1754 because of these competing claims between Britain and France. Twenty-two-year-old Virginian George Washington, a surveyor whose family helped to found the Ohio Company, gave the command to fire on French soldiers near present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. This incident on the Pennsylvania frontier proved to be a decisive event that led to imperial war. For the next decade, fighting took place along the frontier of New France and British America from Virginia to Maine.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>The war also spread to Europe as France and Britain looked to gain supremacy in the Atlantic World.\\n The British fared poorly in the first years of the war. In 1754, the French and their native allies forced Washington to surrender at Fort Necessity, a hastily built fort constructed after his attack on the French. In 1755, Britain dispatched General Edward Braddock to the colonies to take Fort Duquesne. The French, aided by the Potawotomis, Ottawas, Shawnees, and Delawares, ambushed the fifteen hundred British soldiers and Virginia militia who marched to the fort. The attack sent panic through the British force, and hundreds of British soldiers and militiamen died, including General Braddock. The campaign of 1755 proved to be a disaster for the British. In fact, the only British victory that year was the capture of Nova Scotia. In 1756 and 1757, Britain suffered further defeats with the fall of Fort Oswego and Fort William Henry (Figure 4.18).\\n A schematic map depicts the events of the French and Indian War, including troop movements, important battles, and French and British forts.\\n Figure 4.18 This schematic map depicts the events of the French and Indian War. Note the scarcity of British victories.\\n The war began to turn in favor of the British in 1758, due in large part to the efforts of William Pitt, a very popular member of Parliament. Pitt pledged huge sums of money and resources to defeating the hated Catholic French, and Great Britain spent part of the money on bounties paid to new young recruits in the colonies, helping invigorate the British forces. In 1758, the Iroquois, Delaware, and Shawnee signed the Treaty of Easton, aligning themselves with the British in return for some contested land around Pennsylvania and Virginia. In 1759, the British took Quebec, and in 1760, Montreal. The French empire in North America had crumbled.\\n The war continued until 1763, when the French signed the Treaty of Paris. This treaty signaled a dramatic reversal of fortune for France. Indeed, New France, which had been founded in the early 1600s, ceased to exist. The British Empire had now gained mastery over North America. The Empire not only gained New France under the treaty; it also acquired French sugar islands in the West Indies, French trading posts in India, and French-held posts on the west coast of Africa. Great Britain’s victory in the French and Indian War meant that it had become a truly global empire. British colonists joyously celebrated, singing the refrain of “Rule, Britannia! / Britannia, rule the waves! / Britons never, never, never shall be slaves!”\\n In the American colonies, ties with Great Britain were closer than ever. Professional British soldiers had fought alongside Anglo-American militiamen, forging a greater sense of shared identity. With Great Britain’s victory, colonial pride ran high as colonists celebrated their identity as British subjects.\\n This last of the wars for empire, however, also sowed the seeds of trouble. The war led Great Britain deeply into debt, and in the 1760s and 1770s, efforts to deal with the debt through imperial reforms would have the unintended consequence of causing stress and strain that threatened to tear the Empire apart.</chunk3>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement.

(Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nDescribe the socio-political environment in the colonies in the early 1770s\\n Explain the purpose of the Tea Act of 1773 and discuss colonial reactions to it\\nIdentify and describe the Coercive Acts\\nThe Tea Act of 1773 triggered a reaction with far more significant consequences than either the 1765 Stamp Act or the 1767 Townshend Acts. Colonists who had joined in protest against those earlier acts renewed their efforts in 1773. They understood that Parliament had again asserted its right to impose taxes without representation, and they feared the Tea Act was designed to seduce them into conceding this important principle by lowering the price of tea to the point that colonists might abandon their scruples. They also deeply resented the East India Company’s monopoly on the sale of tea in the American colonies; this resentment sprang from the knowledge that some members of Parliament had invested heavily in the company.\\n SMOLDERING RESENTMENT\\n Even after the partial repeal of the Townshend duties, however, suspicion of Parliament’s intentions remained high. This was especially true in port cities like Boston and New York, where British customs agents were a daily irritant and reminder of British power. In public houses and squares, people met and discussed politics. Philosopher John Locke’s Two Treatises of Government, published almost a century earlier, influenced political thought about the role of government to protect life, liberty, and property. The Sons of Liberty issued propaganda ensuring that colonists remained aware when Parliament overreached itself.\\n Violence continued to break out on occasion, as in 1772, when Rhode Island colonists boarded and burned the British revenue ship Gaspée in Narragansett Bay (Figure 5.12). Colonists had attacked or burned British customs ships in the past, but after the Gaspée Affair, the British government convened a Royal Commission of Inquiry. This Commission had the authority to remove the colonists, who were charged with treason, to Great Britain for trial. Some colonial protestors saw this new ability as another example of the overreach of British power.\\n An engraving shows a boat full of colonists watching the Gaspée burn before them. Several of the men have raised their hats into the air.\\n Figure 5.12 This 1883 engraving, which appeared in Harper’s New Monthly Magazine, depicts the burning of the Gaspée. This attack provoked the British government to convene a Royal Commission of Inquiry; some regarded the Commission as an example of excessive British power and control over the colonies.\\n Samuel Adams, along with Joseph Warren and James Otis, re-formed the Boston Committee of Correspondence, which functioned as a form of shadow government, to address the fear of British overreach. Soon towns all over Massachusetts had formed their own committees, and many other colonies followed suit. These committees, which had between seven and eight thousand members in all, identified enemies of the movement and communicated the news of the day. Sometimes they provided a version of events that differed from royal interpretations, and slowly, the committees began to supplant royal governments as sources of information. They later formed the backbone of communication among the colonies in the rebellion against the Tea Act, and eventually in the revolt against the British crown.\\n</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>THE TEA ACT OF 1773\\nParliament did not enact the Tea Act of 1773 in order to punish the colonists, assert parliamentary power, or even raise revenues. Rather, the act was a straightforward order of economic protectionism for a British tea firm, the East India Company, that was on the verge of bankruptcy. In the colonies, tea was the one remaining consumer good subject to the hated Townshend duties. Protest leaders and their followers still avoided British tea, drinking smuggled Dutch tea as a sign of patriotism.\\n The Tea Act of 1773 gave the British East India Company the ability to export its tea directly to the colonies without paying import or export duties and without using middlemen in either Great Britain or the colonies. Even with the Townshend tax, the act would allow the East India Company to sell its tea at lower prices than the smuggled Dutch tea, thus undercutting the smuggling trade.\\n This act was unwelcome to those in British North America who had grown displeased with the pattern of imperial measures. By granting a monopoly to the East India Company, the act not only cut out colonial merchants who would otherwise sell the tea themselves; it also reduced their profits from smuggled foreign tea. These merchants were among the most powerful and influential people in the colonies, so their dissatisfaction carried some weight. Moreover, because the tea tax that the Townshend Acts imposed remained in place, tea had intense power to symbolize the idea of “no taxation without representation.”\\nCOLONIAL PROTEST: THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEA\\nThe 1773 act reignited the worst fears among the colonists. To the Sons and Daughters of Liberty and those who followed them, the act appeared to be proof positive that a handful of corrupt members of Parliament were violating the British Constitution. Veterans of the protest movement had grown accustomed to interpreting British actions in the worst possible light, so the 1773 act appeared to be part of a large conspiracy against liberty.\\n As they had done to protest earlier acts and taxes, colonists responded to the Tea Act with a boycott. The Committees of Correspondence helped to coordinate resistance in all of the colonial port cities, so up and down the East Coast, British tea-carrying ships were unable to come to shore and unload their wares. In Charlestown, Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, the equivalent of millions of dollars’ worth of tea was held hostage, either locked in storage warehouses or rotting in the holds of ships as they were forced to sail back to Great Britain.\\n In Boston, Thomas Hutchinson, now the royal governor of Massachusetts, vowed that radicals like Samuel Adams would not keep the ships from unloading their cargo. He urged the merchants who would have accepted the tea from the ships to stand their ground and receive the tea once it had been unloaded. When the Dartmouth sailed into Boston Harbor in November 1773, it had twenty days to unload its cargo of tea and pay the duty before it had to return to Great Britain. Two more ships, the Eleanor and the Beaver, followed soon after. Samuel Adams and the Sons of Liberty tried to keep the captains of the ships from paying the duties and posted groups around the ships to make sure the tea would not be unloaded.\\n</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>On December 16, just as the Dartmouth’s deadline approached, townspeople gathered at the Old South Meeting House determined to take action. From this gathering, a group of Sons of Liberty and their followers approached the three ships. Some were disguised as Mohawks. Protected by a crowd of spectators, they systematically dumped all the tea into the harbor, destroying goods worth almost $1 million in today’s dollars, a very significant loss. This act soon inspired further acts of resistance up and down the East Coast. However, not all colonists, and not even all Patriots, supported the dumping of the tea. The wholesale destruction of property shocked people on both sides of the Atlantic.\\nCLICK AND EXPLORE\\nTo learn more about the Boston Tea Party, explore the extensive resources in the Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum collection of articles, photos, and video. At the museum itself, you can board replicas of the Eleanor and the Beaver and experience a recreation of the dumping of the tea.\\n PARLIAMENT RESPONDS: THE COERCIVE ACTS\\nIn London, response to the destruction of the tea was swift and strong. The violent destruction of property infuriated King George III and the prime minister, Lord North (Figure 5.13), who insisted the loss be repaid. Though some American merchants put forward a proposal for restitution, the Massachusetts Assembly refused to make payments. Massachusetts’s resistance to British authority united different factions in Great Britain against the colonies. North had lost patience with the unruly British subjects in Boston. He declared: “The Americans have tarred and feathered your subjects, plundered your merchants, burnt your ships, denied all obedience to your laws and authority; yet so clement and so long forbearing has our conduct been that it is incumbent on us now to take a different course. Whatever may be the consequences, we must risk something; if we do not, all is over.” Both Parliament and the king agreed that Massachusetts should be forced to both pay for the tea and yield to British authority.\\n A painting of Lord North.\\n Figure 5.13 Lord North, seen here in Portrait of Frederick North, Lord North (1773–1774), painted by Nathaniel Dance, was prime minister at the time of the destruction of the tea and insisted that Massachusetts make good on the loss.\\n In early 1774, leaders in Parliament responded with a set of four measures designed to punish Massachusetts, commonly known at the Coercive Acts. The Boston Port Act shut down Boston Harbor until the East India Company was repaid. The Massachusetts Government Act placed the colonial government under the direct control of crown officials and made traditional town meetings subject to the governor’s approval. The Administration of Justice Act allowed the royal governor to unilaterally move any trial of a crown officer out of Massachusetts, a change designed to prevent hostile Massachusetts juries from deciding these cases. This act was especially infuriating to John Adams and others who emphasized the time-honored rule of law. They saw this part of the Coercive Acts as striking at the heart of fair and equitable justice. Finally, the Quartering Act encompassed all the colonies and allowed British troops to be housed in occupied buildings.\\n</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>At the same time, Parliament also passed the Quebec Act, which expanded the boundaries of Quebec westward and extended religious tolerance to Roman Catholics in the province. For many Protestant colonists, especially Congregationalists in New England, this forced tolerance of Catholicism was the most objectionable provision of the act. Additionally, expanding the boundaries of Quebec raised troubling questions for many colonists who eyed the West, hoping to expand the boundaries of their provinces. The Quebec Act appeared gratuitous, a slap in the face to colonists already angered by the Coercive Acts.\\n American Patriots renamed the Coercive and Quebec measures the Intolerable Acts. Some in London also thought the acts went too far; see the cartoon “The Able Doctor, or America Swallowing the Bitter Draught” (Figure 5.14) for one British view of what Parliament was doing to the colonies. Meanwhile, punishments designed to hurt only one colony (Massachusetts, in this case) had the effect of mobilizing all the colonies to its side. The Committees of Correspondence had already been active in coordinating an approach to the Tea Act. Now the talk would turn to these new, intolerable assaults on the colonists’ rights as British subjects.\\n A cartoon shows Lord North, with a paper labeled “Boston Port Bill” in his pocket, forcibly pouring tea from a teapot into the mouth of a half-nude woman. One man holds the woman’s arms behind her back, while another holds her feet and looks beneath her skirt. Mother Britannia stands behind the woman, covering her face and weeping. On the ground, a puddle is labeled “Boston Petition.”\\n Figure 5.14 The artist of “The Able Doctor, or America Swallowing the Bitter Draught” (London Magazine, May 1, 1774) targets select members of Parliament as the perpetrators of a devilish scheme to overturn the constitution; this is why Mother Britannia weeps. Note that this cartoon came from a British publication; Great Britain was not united in support of Parliament’s policies toward the American colonies.</chunk4>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYou are asked to write a main idea multiple-choice question based on an academic text summary provided by the user. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\nNOTE: The user may provide an already generated question with evaluations, in which case you should revise the provided question based on the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] and the evaluations.\\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are main idea questions?**\\nMain idea questions assess a student\\'s ability to identify the central point or primary argument of a text, passage, or section.\\nInstead of focusing on specific details, examples, or minor points, these questions target the big picture — what the author is fundamentally trying to convey.\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Carefully read the TEXT to understand its main idea.  \\nStep2: Write a clear question stem. Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags. The answer should contain the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D) and the text of the correct answer. Example:\\n<ANSWER>A) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.</ANSWER>\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"<text>\\nLearning Objectives outline goals such as understanding the socio-political environment of the colonies in the early 1770s, explaining the Tea Act of 1773, and identifying the Coercive Acts.

They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nExplain the British and American strategies of 1776 through 1778\\nIdentify the key battles of the early years of the Revolution\\nAfter the British quit Boston, they slowly adopted a strategy to isolate New England from the rest of the colonies and force the insurgents in that region into submission, believing that doing so would end the conflict. At first, British forces focused on taking the principal colonial centers. They began by easily capturing New York City in 1776. The following year, they took over the American capital of Philadelphia. The larger British effort to isolate New England was implemented in 1777. That effort ultimately failed when the British surrendered a force of over five thousand to the Americans in the fall of 1777 at the Battle of Saratoga.\\n The major campaigns over the next several years took place in the middle colonies of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, whose populations were sharply divided between Loyalists and Patriots. Revolutionaries faced many hardships as British superiority on the battlefield became evident and the difficulty of funding the war caused strains.\\n THE BRITISH STRATEGY IN THE MIDDLE COLONIES\\nAfter evacuating Boston in March 1776, British forces sailed to Nova Scotia to regroup. They devised a strategy, successfully implemented in 1776, to take New York City. The following year, they planned to end the rebellion by cutting New England off from the rest of the colonies and starving it into submission. Three British armies were to move simultaneously from New York City, Montreal, and Fort Oswego to converge along the Hudson River; British control of that natural boundary would isolate New England.\\n General William Howe (Figure 6.9), commander in chief of the British forces in America, amassed thirty-two thousand troops on Staten Island in June and July 1776. His brother, Admiral Richard Howe, controlled New York Harbor. Command of New York City and the Hudson River was their goal. In August 1776, General Howe landed his forces on Long Island and easily routed the American Continental Army there in the Battle of Long Island (August 27). The Americans were outnumbered and lacked both military experience and discipline. Sensing victory, General and Admiral Howe arranged a peace conference in September 1776, where Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and South Carolinian John Rutledge represented the Continental Congress. Despite the Howes’ hopes, however, the Americans demanded recognition of their independence, which the Howes were not authorized to grant, and the conference disbanded.\\n A portrait of General William Howe is shown. He wears a red military coat, a tricorner hat, and a sword.\\n Figure 6.9 General William Howe, shown here in a 1777 portrait by Richard Purcell, led British forces in America in the first years of the war.\\n On September 16, 1776, George Washington’s forces held up against the British at the Battle of Harlem Heights. This important American military achievement, a key reversal after the disaster on Long Island, occurred as most of Washington’s forces retreated to New Jersey. A few weeks later, on October 28, General Howe’s forces defeated Washington’s at the Battle of White Plains and New York City fell to the British.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>For the next seven years, the British made the city the headquarters for their military efforts to defeat the rebellion, which included raids on surrounding areas. In 1777, the British burned Danbury, Connecticut, and in July 1779, they set fire to homes in Fairfield and Norwalk. They held American prisoners aboard ships in the waters around New York City; the death toll was shocking, with thousands perishing in the holds. Meanwhile, New York City served as a haven for Loyalists who disagreed with the effort to break away from the Empire and establish an American republic.\\n GEORGE WASHINGTON AND THE CONTINENTAL ARMY\\n When the Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in May 1775, members approved the creation of a professional Continental Army with Washington as commander in chief (Figure 6.10). Although sixteen thousand volunteers enlisted, it took several years for the Continental Army to become a truly professional force. In 1775 and 1776, militias still composed the bulk of the Patriots’ armed forces, and these soldiers returned home after the summer fighting season, drastically reducing the army’s strength.\\n An etching shows troops on foot and on horseback gathered in formation on Cambridge Common. George Washington is in the center on horseback raising his hat.\\n Figure 6.10 This 1775 etching shows George Washington taking command of the Continental Army at Cambridge, Massachusetts, just two weeks after his appointment by the Continental Congress.\\n That changed in late 1776 and early 1777, when Washington broke with conventional eighteenth-century military tactics that called for fighting in the summer months only. Intent on raising revolutionary morale after the British captured New York City, he launched surprise strikes against British forces in their winter quarters. In Trenton, New Jersey, he led his soldiers across the Delaware River and surprised an encampment of Hessians, German mercenaries hired by Great Britain to put down the American rebellion. Beginning the night of December 25, 1776, and continuing into the early hours of December 26, Washington moved on Trenton where the Hessians were encamped. Maintaining the element of surprise by attacking at Christmastime, he defeated them, taking over nine hundred captive. On January 3, 1777, Washington achieved another much-needed victory at the Battle of Princeton. He again broke with eighteenth-century military protocol by attacking unexpectedly after the fighting season had ended.\\n DEFINING AMERICAN\\nThomas Paine on “The American Crisis”\\nDuring the American Revolution, following the publication of Common Sense in January 1776, Thomas Paine began a series of sixteen pamphlets known collectively as The American Crisis (Figure 6.11). He wrote the first volume in 1776, describing the dire situation facing the revolutionaries at the end of that hard year.\\n The first page of Thomas Paine’s The American Crisis is shown. It is subtitled “By the Author of COMMON SENSE.”\\n Figure 6.11 Thomas Paine wrote the pamphlet The American Crisis, the first page of which is shown here, in 1776.\\n These are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. . . .</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right (not only to tax) but “to bind us in all cases whatsoever,” and if being bound in that manner, is not slavery, then is there not such a thing as slavery upon earth. Even the expression is impious; for so unlimited a power can belong only to God. . . .\\n I shall conclude this paper with some miscellaneous remarks on the state of our affairs; and shall begin with asking the following question, Why is it that the enemy have left the New England provinces, and made these middle ones the seat of war? The answer is easy: New England is not infested with Tories, and we are. I have been tender in raising the cry against these men, and used numberless arguments to show them their danger, but it will not do to sacrifice a world either to their folly or their baseness. The period is now arrived, in which either they or we must change our sentiments, or one or both must fall. . . .\\n By perseverance and fortitude we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and submission, the sad choice of a variety of evils—a ravaged country—a depopulated city—habitations without safety, and slavery without hope—our homes turned into barracks and bawdy-houses for Hessians, and a future race to provide for, whose fathers we shall doubt of. Look on this picture and weep over it! and if there yet remains one thoughtless wretch who believes it not, let him suffer it unlamented.\\n —Thomas Paine, “The American Crisis,” December 23, 1776\\n What topics does Paine address in this pamphlet?

That fall, the British defeated Washington’s soldiers in the Battle of Brandywine Creek and took control of Philadelphia, forcing the Continental Congress to flee. During the winter of 1777–1778, the British occupied the city, and Washington’s army camped at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.\\n Washington’s winter at Valley Forge was a low point for the American forces. A lack of supplies weakened the men, and disease took a heavy toll. Amid the cold, hunger, and sickness, soldiers deserted in droves. On February 16, Washington wrote to George Clinton, governor of New York: “For some days past, there has been little less than a famine in camp. A part of the army has been a week without any kind of flesh & the rest three or four days. Naked and starving as they are, we cannot enough admire the incomparable patience and fidelity of the soldiery, that they have not been ere</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>[before] this excited by their sufferings to a general mutiny and dispersion.” Of eleven thousand soldiers encamped at Valley Forge, twenty-five hundred died of starvation, malnutrition, and disease. As Washington feared, nearly one hundred soldiers deserted every week. (Desertions continued, and by 1780, Washington was executing recaptured deserters every Saturday.) The low morale extended all the way to Congress, where some wanted to replace Washington with a more seasoned leader.\\n Assistance came to Washington and his soldiers in February 1778 in the form of the Prussian soldier Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben (Figure 6.12). Baron von Steuben was an experienced military man, and he implemented a thorough training course for Washington’s ragtag troops. By drilling a small corps of soldiers and then having them train others, he finally transformed the Continental Army into a force capable of standing up to the professional British and Hessian soldiers. His drill manual—Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States—informed military practices in the United States for the next several decades.\\n A portrait of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben is shown. He wears a black military coat and a number of medals and ribbons, and rests his hand on a sword.\\n Figure 6.12 Prussian soldier Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, shown here in a 1786 portrait by Ralph Earl, was instrumental in transforming Washington’s Continental Army into a professional armed force.\\n CLICK AND EXPLORE\\nExplore Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben’s Revolutionary War Drill Manual to understand how von Steuben was able to transform the Continental Army into a professional fighting force. Note the tremendous amount of precision and detail in von Steuben’s descriptions.\\n Meanwhile, the campaign to sever New England from the rest of the colonies had taken an unexpected turn during the fall of 1777. The British had attempted to implement the plan, drawn up by Lord George Germain and Prime Minister Lord North, to isolate New England with the combined forces of three armies. One army, led by General John Burgoyne, would march south from Montreal. A second force, led by Colonel Barry St. Leger and made up of British troops and Iroquois, would march east from Fort Oswego on the banks of Lake Ontario. A third force, led by General Sir Henry Clinton, would march north from New York City. The armies would converge at Albany and effectively cut the rebellion in two by isolating New England. This northern campaign fell victim to competing strategies, however, as General Howe had meanwhile decided to take Philadelphia. His decision to capture that city siphoned off troops that would have been vital to the overall success of the campaign in 1777.\\n The British plan to isolate New England ended in disaster. St. Leger’s efforts to bring his force of British regulars, Loyalist fighters, and Iroquois allies east to link up with General Burgoyne failed, and he retreated to Quebec. Burgoyne’s forces encountered ever-stiffer resistance as he made his way south from Montreal, down Lake Champlain and the upper Hudson River corridor. Although they did capture Fort Ticonderoga when American forces retreated, Burgoyne’s army found themselves surrounded by a sea of colonial militias in Saratoga, New York.</chunk4>\\n\\n<chunk5>In the meantime, the small British force under Clinton that left New York City to aid Burgoyne advanced slowly up the Hudson River, failing to provide the much-needed support for the troops at Saratoga. On October 17, 1777, Burgoyne surrendered his five thousand soldiers to the Continental Army (Figure 6.13).\\n A 1784 German engraving shows British soldiers laying down their muskets before the American forces, who watch from horseback in the foreground.\\n Figure 6.13 This German engraving, created by Daniel Chodowiecki in 1784, shows British soldiers laying down their arms before the American forces.\\n The American victory at the Battle of Saratoga was the major turning point in the war. This victory convinced the French to recognize American independence and form a military alliance with the new nation, which changed the course of the war by opening the door to badly needed military support from France. Still smarting from their defeat by Britain in the Seven Years’ War, the French supplied the United States with gunpowder and money, as well as soldiers and naval forces that proved decisive in the defeat of Great Britain. The French also contributed military leaders, including the Marquis de Lafayette, who arrived in America in 1777 as a volunteer and served as Washington’s aide-de-camp.\\n The war quickly became more difficult for the British, who had to fight the rebels in North America as well as the French in the Caribbean. Following France’s lead, Spain joined the war against Great Britain in 1779, though it did not recognize American independence until 1783. The Dutch Republic also began to support the American revolutionaries and signed a treaty of commerce with the United States in 1782.\\n Great Britain’s effort to isolate New England in 1777 failed. In June 1778, the occupying British force in Philadelphia evacuated and returned to New York City in order to better defend that city, and the British then turned their attention to the southern colonies.</chunk5>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

The British aimed to isolate New England and successfully captured significant cities like New York and Philadelphia but failed in their broader isolation strategy after the Americans won the Battle of Saratoga. Meanwhile, the revolution introduced challenges like military superiority of the British and funding difficulties. The British strategy in the middle colonies was also detailed, highlighting specific military movements and battles, such as the Battle of Long Island and Harlem Heights.  British efforts to suppress the rebellion included brutal raids and using New York City as headquarters. The Continental Army led by George Washington faced challenges but also breakthroughs, illustrated by strategic victories at Trenton and Princeton. Thomas Paine wrote 'The American Crisis' to inspire morale among revolutionaries, criticizing Tory loyalty to Britain and underscoring the dire stakes of the conflict.  Paine’s writings called for tenacity against British tyranny, castigating Loyalists, and appealing to patriot persistence for a ‘glorious issue’ against submission. Details describe British maneuvers in 1777 including the overrunning of Philadelphia and the harsh winter at Valley Forge. Washington’s letter details the army's dire straits due to deprivation, coincident with lingering pressures from within the Continental Congress.  The narrative at Valley Forge includes aid arriving with Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, who instituted essential military training transforming the Continental Army. The British campaign to sever New England met failure due to poor coordination and strategic decision-making, pivotal within America's eventual success at Saratoga.  Saratoga marked a decisive turning point prompting French support via a military alliance, altering the war dynamics and contributing new resources and leadership. This juncture led to broader European involvement against Britain and highlighted failing British isolation strategies, realigning their focus to the southern colonies.\\n</text>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

The British aimed to isolate New England and successfully captured significant cities like New York and Philadelphia but failed in their broader isolation strategy after the Americans won the Battle of Saratoga. Meanwhile, the revolution introduced challenges like military superiority of the British and funding difficulties. The British strategy in the middle colonies was also detailed, highlighting specific military movements and battles, such as the Battle of Long Island and Harlem Heights.  British efforts to suppress the rebellion included brutal raids and using New York City as headquarters. The Continental Army led by George Washington faced challenges but also breakthroughs, illustrated by strategic victories at Trenton and Princeton. Thomas Paine wrote 'The American Crisis' to inspire morale among revolutionaries, criticizing Tory loyalty to Britain and underscoring the dire stakes of the conflict.  Paine’s writings called for tenacity against British tyranny, castigating Loyalists, and appealing to patriot persistence for a ‘glorious issue’ against submission. Details describe British maneuvers in 1777 including the overrunning of Philadelphia and the harsh winter at Valley Forge. Washington’s letter details the army's dire straits due to deprivation, coincident with lingering pressures from within the Continental Congress.  The narrative at Valley Forge includes aid arriving with Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, who instituted essential military training transforming the Continental Army. The British campaign to sever New England met failure due to poor coordination and strategic decision-making, pivotal within America's eventual success at Saratoga.  Saratoga marked a decisive turning point prompting French support via a military alliance, altering the war dynamics and contributing new resources and leadership. This juncture led to broader European involvement against Britain and highlighted failing British isolation strategies, realigning their focus to the southern colonies.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\n\\n</contextual_text>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nOutline the British southern strategy and its results\\nDescribe key American victories and the end of the war\\nIdentify the main terms of the Treaty of Paris (1783)\\n By 1778, the war had turned into a stalemate. Although some in Britain, including Prime Minister Lord North, wanted peace, King George III demanded that the colonies be brought to obedience. To break the deadlock, the British revised their strategy and turned their attention to the southern colonies, where they could expect more support from Loyalists. The southern colonies soon became the center of the fighting. The southern strategy brought the British success at first, but thanks to the leadership of George Washington and General Nathanael Greene and the crucial assistance of French forces, the Continental Army defeated the British at Yorktown, effectively ending further large-scale operations during the war.\\n GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA\\n The British architect of the war strategy, Lord George Germain, believed Britain would gain the upper hand with the support of Loyalists, enslaved people, and Native American allies in the South, and indeed, this southern strategy initially achieved great success. The British began their southern campaign by capturing Savannah, the capital of Georgia, in December 1778. In Georgia, they found support from thousands of enslaved individuals who ran to the British side to escape their bondage. As the British regained political control in Georgia, they forced the inhabitants to swear allegiance to the king and formed twenty Loyalist regiments. The Continental Congress had suggested that enslaved people be given freedom if they joined the Patriot army against the British, but revolutionaries in Georgia and South Carolina refused to consider this proposal. Once again, the Revolution served to further divisions over race and slavery.\\n After taking Georgia, the British turned their attention to South Carolina. Before the Revolution, South Carolina had been starkly divided between the backcountry, which harbored revolutionary partisans, and the coastal regions, where Loyalists remained a powerful force. Waves of violence rocked the backcountry from the late 1770s into the early 1780s. The Revolution provided an opportunity for residents to fight over their local resentments and antagonisms with murderous consequences. Revenge killings and the destruction of property became mainstays in the savage civil war that gripped the South.\\n In April 1780, a British force of eight thousand soldiers besieged American forces in Charleston (Figure 6.14). After six weeks of the Siege of Charleston, the British triumphed. General Benjamin Lincoln, who led the effort for the revolutionaries, had to surrender his entire force, the largest American loss during the entire war. Many of the defeated Americans were placed in jails or in British prison ships anchored in Charleston Harbor. The British established a military government in Charleston under the command of General Sir Henry Clinton. From this base, Clinton ordered General Charles Cornwallis to subdue the rest of South Carolina.\\n Image (a) shows a 1780 British map of Charleston with details of the locations of Continental forces. A portrait of General Nathanael Greene is shown in image (b).\\n Figure 6.14 This 1780 map of Charleston (a), which shows details of the Continental defenses, was probably drawn by British engineers in anticipation of the attack on the city.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>The Siege of Charleston was one of a series of defeats for the Continental forces in the South, which led the Continental Congress to place General Nathanael Greene (b), shown here in a 1783 portrait by Charles Wilson Peale, in command in late 1780. Greene led his troops to two crucial victories.\\n The disaster at Charleston led the Continental Congress to change leadership by placing General Horatio Gates in charge of American forces in the South. However, General Gates fared no better than General Lincoln; at the Battle of Camden, South Carolina, in August 1780, Cornwallis forced General Gates to retreat into North Carolina. Camden was one of the worst disasters suffered by American armies during the entire Revolutionary War. Congress again changed military leadership, this time by placing General Nathanael Greene (Figure 6.14) in command in December 1780.\\n As the British had hoped, large numbers of Loyalists helped ensure the success of the southern strategy, and thousands of enslaved individuals seeking freedom arrived to aid Cornwallis’s army. However, the war turned in the Americans’ favor in 1781. General Greene realized that to defeat Cornwallis, he did not have to win a single battle. So long as he remained in the field, he could continue to destroy isolated British forces. Greene therefore made a strategic decision to divide his own troops to wage war—and the strategy worked. American forces under General Daniel Morgan decisively beat the British at the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina. General Cornwallis now abandoned his strategy of defeating the backcountry rebels in South Carolina. Determined to destroy Greene’s army, he gave chase as Greene strategically retreated north into North Carolina. At the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in March 1781, the British prevailed on the battlefield but suffered extensive losses, an outcome that paralleled the Battle of Bunker Hill nearly six years earlier in June 1775.\\n YORKTOWN\\nIn the summer of 1781, Cornwallis moved his army to Yorktown, Virginia. He expected the Royal Navy to transport his army to New York, where he thought he would join General Sir Henry Clinton. Yorktown was a tobacco port on a peninsula, and Cornwallis believed the British navy would be able to keep the coast clear of rebel ships. Sensing an opportunity, a combined French and American force of sixteen thousand men swarmed the peninsula in September 1781. Washington raced south with his forces, now a disciplined army, as did the Marquis de Lafayette and the Comte de Rochambeau with their French troops. The French Admiral de Grasse sailed his naval force into Chesapeake Bay, preventing Lord Cornwallis from taking a seaward escape route.\\n In October 1781, the American forces began the battle for Yorktown, and after a siege that lasted eight days, Lord Cornwallis capitulated on October 19 (Figure 6.15). Tradition says that during the surrender of his troops, the British band played “The World Turned Upside Down,” a song that befitted the Empire’s unexpected reversal of fortune.\\n A painting depicts American general Benjamin Lincoln holding out his hand to receive the British general’s sword as he formally surrenders. General George Washington is in the background, mounted on horseback. British and American troops are lined up, at attention, on opposite sides of the field; the Americans stand under an American flag, while the British soldiers stand under a white flag.\\n</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Figure 6.15 The 1820 painting above, by John Trumbull, is titled Surrender of Lord Cornwallis, but Cornwallis actually sent his general, Charles O’Hara, to perform the ceremonial surrendering of the sword.

General George Washington is in the background on the brown horse, since he refused to accept the sword from anyone but Cornwallis himself.\\n DEFINING AMERICAN\\n“The World Turned Upside Down”\\n“The World Turned Upside Down,” reputedly played during the surrender of the British at Yorktown, was a traditional English ballad from the seventeenth century. It was also the theme of a popular British print that circulated in the 1790s (Figure 6.16).\\n A sixteen-paneled print shows a series of images in which animals and humans switch places; women adopt men’s roles; fish fly through the air; and the sun, moon, and stars appear below the earth.\\n Figure 6.16 In many of the images in this popular print, entitled “The World Turned Upside Down or the Folly of Man,” animals and humans have switched places. In one, children take care of their parents, while in another, the sun, moon, and stars appear below the earth.\\n Why do you think these images were popular in Great Britain in the decade following the Revolutionary War? What would these images imply to Americans?\\nCLICK AND EXPLORE\\nVisit the Public Domain Review to explore the images in an eighteenth-century British chapbook (a pamphlet for tracts or ballads) titled “The World Turned Upside Down.” The chapbook is illustrated with woodcuts similar to those in the popular print mentioned above.\\n THE TREATY OF PARIS\\nThe British defeat at Yorktown made the outcome of the war all but certain. In light of the American victory, the Parliament of Great Britain voted to end further military operations against the rebels and to begin peace negotiations. Support for the war effort had come to an end, and British military forces began to evacuate the former American colonies in 1782. When hostilities had ended, Washington resigned as commander in chief and returned to his Virginia home.\\n In April 1782, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay had begun informal peace negotiations in Paris. Officials from Great Britain and the United States finalized the treaty in 1783, signing the Treaty of Paris (Figure 6.17) in September of that year. The treaty recognized the independence of the United States; placed the western, eastern, northern, and southern boundaries of the nation at the Mississippi River, the Atlantic Ocean, Canada, and Florida, respectively; and gave New Englanders fishing rights in the waters off Newfoundland. Under the terms of the treaty, individual states were encouraged to refrain from persecuting Loyalists and to return their confiscated property.\\n The final page of the Treaty of Paris is shown, bearing the signatures and seals of David Hartley, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay.\\n Figure 6.17 The last page of the Treaty of Paris, signed on September 3, 1783, contained the signatures and seals of representatives for both the British and the Americans. From right to left, the seals pictured belong to David Hartley, who represented Great Britain, and John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay for the Americans.</chunk3>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYou are asked to write a main idea multiple-choice question based on an academic text summary provided by the user. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\nNOTE: The user may provide an already generated question with evaluations, in which case you should revise the provided question based on the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] and the evaluations.\\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are main idea questions?**\\nMain idea questions assess a student\\'s ability to identify the central point or primary argument of a text, passage, or section.\\nInstead of focusing on specific details, examples, or minor points, these questions target the big picture — what the author is fundamentally trying to convey.\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Carefully read the TEXT to understand its main idea.  \\nStep2: Write a clear question stem. Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags. The answer should contain the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D) and the text of the correct answer. Example:\\n<ANSWER>A) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.</ANSWER>\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"<text>\\nThe British revised their war strategy in 1778, focusing on the southern colonies, where they initially found success with support from Loyalists, enslaved people, and Native Americans, capturing Savannah and Charleston.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nCompare and contrast monarchy and republican government\\nDescribe the tenets of republicanism\\nA timeline shows important events of the era. In 1776–1780s, the states draft revolutionary constitutions; a state constitution is shown. In 1781, the Continental Congress ratifies the Articles of Confederation; the first page of the Articles of Confederation is shown. In 1784–1787, the Northwest Ordinances outline the process for the sale of new lands.

In 1787, the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention drafts a plan for the federal government; a painting of the Constitutional Convention is shown. In 1787–1788, the Constitution is debated across the country.\\n Figure 7.2\\nWhile monarchies dominated eighteenth-century Europe, American revolutionaries were determined to find an alternative to this method of government. Radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine, whose enormously popular essay Common Sense was first published in January 1776, advocated a republic: a state without a king. Six months later, Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence affirmed the break with England but did not suggest what form of government should replace monarchy, the only system most English colonists had ever known. In the late eighteenth century, republics were few and far between. Genoa, Venice, and the Dutch Republic provided examples of states without monarchs, but many European Enlightenment thinkers questioned the stability of a republic. Nonetheless, after their break from Great Britain, Americans turned to republicanism for their new government.\\n REPUBLICANISM AS A POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY\\nMonarchy rests on the practice of dynastic succession, in which the monarch’s child or other relative inherits the throne. Contested dynastic succession produced chronic conflict and warfare in Europe. In the eighteenth century, well-established monarchs ruled most of Europe and, according to tradition, were obligated to protect and guide their subjects. However, by the mid-1770s, many American colonists believed that George III, the king of Great Britain, had failed to do so. Patriots believed the British monarchy under George III had been corrupted and the king turned into a tyrant who cared nothing for the traditional liberties afforded to members of the British Empire. The disaffection from monarchy explains why a republic appeared a better alternative to the revolutionaries.\\n American revolutionaries looked to the past for inspiration for their break with the British monarchy and their adoption of a republican form of government. The Roman Republic provided guidance. Much like the Americans in their struggle against Britain, Romans had thrown off monarchy and created a republic in which Roman citizens would appoint or select the leaders who would represent them.\\n CLICK AND EXPLORE\\nVisit the Metropolitan Museum of Art to see a Roman-style bust of George Washington, complete with toga. In 1791, Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi visited Philadelphia, hoping the government might commission a monument of his creation. He did not succeed, but the bust of Washington, one of the ones he produced to demonstrate his skill, illustrates the connection between the American and Roman republics that revolutionaries made.\\n While republicanism offered an alternative to monarchy, it was also an alternative to democracy, a system of government characterized by majority rule, where the majority of citizens have the power to make decisions binding upon the whole.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>To many revolutionaries, especially wealthy landowners, merchants, and planters, democracy did not offer a good replacement for monarchy. Indeed, conservative Whigs defined themselves in opposition to democracy, which they equated with anarchy. In the tenth in a series of essays later known as The Federalist Papers, Virginian James Madison wrote: “Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.” Many shared this perspective and worked hard to keep democratic tendencies in check. It is easy to understand why democracy seemed threatening: majority rule can easily overpower minority rights, and the wealthy few had reason to fear that a hostile and envious majority could seize and redistribute their wealth.\\n While many now assume the United States was founded as a democracy, history, as always, is more complicated. Conservative Whigs believed in government by a patrician class, a ruling group composed of a small number of privileged families. Radical Whigs favored broadening the popular participation in political life and pushed for democracy. The great debate after independence was secured centered on this question: Who should rule in the new American republic?\\nREPUBLICANISM AS A SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY\\n According to political theory, a republic requires its citizens to cultivate virtuous behavior; if the people are virtuous, the republic will survive. If the people become corrupt, the republic will fall. Whether republicanism succeeded or failed in the United States would depend on civic virtue and an educated citizenry. Revolutionary leaders agreed that the ownership of property provided one way to measure an individual’s virtue, arguing that property holders had the greatest stake in society and therefore could be trusted to make decisions for it. By the same token, non-property holders, they believed, should have very little to do with government. In other words, unlike a democracy, in which the mass of non-property holders could exercise the political right to vote, a republic would limit political rights to property holders. In this way, republicanism exhibited a bias toward the elite, a preference that is understandable given the colonial legacy. During colonial times, wealthy planters and merchants in the American colonies had looked to the British ruling class, whose social order demanded deference from those of lower rank, as a model of behavior. Old habits died hard.\\n DEFINING AMERICAN\\nBenjamin Franklin’s Thirteen Virtues for Character Development\\nIn the 1780s, Benjamin Franklin carefully defined thirteen virtues to help guide his countrymen in maintaining a virtuous republic. His choice of thirteen is telling since he wrote for the citizens of the thirteen new American republics. These virtues were:\\n1. Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\\n 2. Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.\\n 3. Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.\\n 4. Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.\\n 5. Frugality.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.\\n 6. Industry. Lose no time; be always employ’d in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.\\n 7. Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.\\n 8. Justice. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.\\n 9. Moderation. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.\\n 10. Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.\\n 11. Tranquillity. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.\\n 12. Chastity. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another’s peace or reputation.\\n13. Humility. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.\\n Franklin’s thirteen virtues suggest that hard work and good behavior will bring success. What factors does Franklin ignore? How would he likely address a situation in which children inherit great wealth rather than working for it? How do Franklin’s values help to define the notion of republican virtue?\\nCLICK AND EXPLORE\\nCheck how well you are demonstrating all thirteen of Franklin’s virtues on thirteenvirtues.com, where you can register to track your progress.\\n George Washington served as a role model par excellence for the new republic, embodying the exceptional talent and public virtue prized under the political and social philosophy of republicanism. He did not seek to become the new king of America; instead he retired as commander in chief of the Continental Army and returned to his Virginia estate at Mount Vernon to resume his life among the planter elite. Washington modeled his behavior on that of the Roman aristocrat Cincinnatus, a representative of the patrician or ruling class, who had also retired from public service in the Roman Republic and returned to his estate to pursue agricultural life.\\n The aristocratic side of republicanism—and the belief that the true custodians of public virtue were those who had served in the military—found expression in the Society of the Cincinnati, of which Washington was the first president general (Figure 7.3). Founded in 1783, the society admitted only officers of the Continental Army and the French forces, not militia members or minutemen. Following the rule of primogeniture, the eldest sons of members inherited their fathers’ memberships. The society still exists today and retains the motto Omnia relinquit servare rempublicam (“He relinquished everything to save the Republic”).\\n A membership certificate for the Society of the Cincinnati is shown. The language on the certificate commemorates “the great Event which gave Independence to North America.”\\n Figure 7.3 This membership certificate for the Society of the Cincinnati commemorates “the great Event which gave Independence to North America.”</chunk3>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

The Articles of Confederation and events like Shays' Rebellion highlighted the era's political changes. Monarchies were viewed as corrupt and tyrannical under George III, leading to the adoption of republican ideals. These ideals were inspired by the Roman Republic, contrasting with democracy which many revolutionaries saw as equivalent to anarchy. Republicanism promoted a government based on civic virtue and educated citizenry, with the belief that property holders were best suited to lead.\\nWhile some saw democracy as a threat, especially to property rights, republicanism offered a system that emphasized civic virtue and educated citizens. Benjamin Franklin outlined thirteen virtues to guide citizens, emphasizing attributes like temperance, order, and frugality as essential for maintaining a republic. Republicanism favored property holders in politics, reflecting colonial habits of deference to a ruling elite.\\nFranklin's virtues prioritized industrious and virtuous lives, ignoring factors like inherited wealth. George Washington exemplified republican virtues by retiring to private life after public service, drawing parallels to Cincinnatus of Rome. The Society of the Cincinnati, with Washington as its first president, embodied elitist aspects of republicanism, limiting membership to military officers and reinforcing the idea of an aristocracy in virtue and service.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\n\\n</contextual_text>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nDescribe the causes and consequences of the War of 1812\\nIdentify the important events of the War of 1812 and explain their significance\\nThe origins of the War of 1812, often called the Second War of American Independence, are found in the unresolved issues between the United States and Great Britain. One major cause was the British practice of impressment, whereby American sailors were taken at sea and forced to fight on British warships; this issue was left unresolved by Jay’s Treaty in 1794. In addition, the British in Canada supported Native Americans in their fight against further U.S. expansion in the Great Lakes region. Though Jefferson wanted to avoid what he called “entangling alliances,” staying neutral proved impossible.\\n THE EMBARGO OF 1807\\nFrance and England, engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, which raged between 1803 and 1815, both declared open season on American ships, which they seized on the high seas. England was the major offender, since the Royal Navy, following a time-honored practice, “impressed” American sailors by forcing them into its service. The issue came to a head in 1807 when the HMS Leopard, a British warship, fired on a U.S. naval ship, the Chesapeake, off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia. The British then boarded the ship and took four sailors. Jefferson chose what he thought was the best of his limited options and responded to the crisis through the economic means of a sweeping ban on trade, the Embargo Act of 1807. This law prohibited American ships from leaving their ports until Britain and France stopped seizing them on the high seas. As a result of the embargo, American commerce came to a near-total halt.\\n The logic behind the embargo was that cutting off all trade would so severely hurt Britain and France that the seizures at sea would end. However, while the embargo did have some effect on the British economy, it was American commerce that actually felt the brunt of the impact (Figure 8.15). The embargo hurt American farmers, who could no longer sell their goods overseas, and seaport cities experienced a huge increase in unemployment and an uptick in bankruptcies. All told, American business activity declined by 75 percent from 1808 to 1809.\\n A cartoon shows a snapping turtle, who holds a shipping license, biting a smuggler in the act of sneaking a barrel of sugar to a British ship. The smuggler cries, “Oh, this cursed Ograbme!” His companion cries “D—n it. how he nicks ‘em!”\\n Figure 8.15 In this political cartoon from 1807, a snapping turtle (holding a shipping license) grabs a smuggler in the act of sneaking a barrel of sugar to a British ship. The smuggler cries, “Oh, this cursed Ograbme!” (“Ograbme” is “embargo” spelled backwards.)\\n Enforcement of the embargo proved very difficult, especially in the states bordering British Canada. Smuggling was widespread; Smugglers’ Notch in Vermont, for example, earned its name from illegal trade with British Canada.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Jefferson attributed the problems with the embargo to lax enforcement.\\n At the very end of his second term, Jefferson signed the Non-Intercourse Act of 1808, lifting the unpopular embargoes on trade except with Britain and France. In the election of 1808, American voters elected another Democratic-Republican, James Madison. Madison inherited Jefferson’s foreign policy issues involving Britain and France. Most people in the United States, especially those in the West, saw Great Britain as the major problem.\\n TECUMSEH AND THE WESTERN CONFEDERACY\\nAnother underlying cause of the War of 1812 was British support for native resistance to U.S. western expansion. For many years, White settlers in the American western territories had besieged the Native Americans living there. Under Jefferson, two policies existed: forcing Native Americans to adopt American ways of agricultural life, or aggressively driving them into debt in order to force them to sell their lands.\\n In 1809, Tecumseh, a Shawnee war chief, rejuvenated the Western Confederacy. His brother, Tenskwatawa, was a prophet among the Shawnee who urged a revival of native ways and rejection of Anglo-American culture, including alcohol. In 1811, William Henry Harrison, the governor of the Indiana Territory, attempted to eliminate the native presence by attacking Prophetstown, a Shawnee settlement named in honor of Tenskwatawa. In the ensuing Battle of Tippecanoe, U.S. forces led by Harrison destroyed the settlement (Figure 8.16). They also found ample evidence that the British had supplied the Western Confederacy with weapons, despite the stipulations of earlier treaties.\\n Painting (a) is a portrait of Tenskwatawa, who wears metal earrings and collar and a red cloth hat with feathers. His right eye is missing. Painting (b) is a portrait of William Henry Harrison, who wears an elaborate military uniform.\\n Figure 8.16 Portrait (a), painted by Charles Bird King in 1820, is a depiction of Shawnee prophet Tenskwatawa. Portrait (b) is Rembrandt Peele’s 1813 depiction of William Henry Harrison. What are the significant similarities and differences between the portraits? What was each artist trying to convey?\\n THE WAR OF 1812\\nThe seizure of American ships and sailors, combined with the British support of Native American resistance, led to strident calls for war against Great Britain. The loudest came from the “war hawks,” led by Henry Clay from Kentucky and John C. Calhoun from South Carolina, who would not tolerate British insults to American honor. Opposition to the war came from Federalists, especially those in the Northeast, who knew war would disrupt the maritime trade on which they depended. In a narrow vote, Congress authorized the president to declare war against Britain in June 1812.\\n The war went very badly for the United States at first. In August 1812, the United States lost Detroit to the British and their Native allies, including a force of one thousand men led by Tecumseh. By the end of the year, the British controlled half the Northwest. The following year, however, U.S. forces scored several victories. Captain Oliver Hazard Perry and his naval force defeated the British on Lake Erie. At the Battle of the Thames in Ontario, the United States defeated the British and their native allies, and Tecumseh was counted among the dead.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Native American resistance began to ebb, opening the Indiana and Michigan territories for White settlement.\\n These victories could not turn the tide of the war, however. With the British gaining the upper hand during the Napoleonic Wars and Napoleon’s French army on the run, Great Britain now could divert skilled combat troops from Europe to fight in the United States. In July 1814, forty-five hundred hardened British soldiers sailed up the Chesapeake Bay and burned Washington, DC, to the ground, forcing President Madison and his wife to run for their lives (Figure 8.17). According to one report, they left behind a dinner the British officers ate. That summer, the British shelled Baltimore, hoping for another victory. However, they failed to dislodge the U.S. forces, whose survival of the bombardment inspired Francis Scott Key to write “The Star-Spangled Banner.”\\n A painting depicts the burned White House, which is blackened inside with smoke damage visible on its exterior.\\n Figure 8.17 George Munger painted The President’s House shortly after the War of 1812, ca. 1814–1815. The painting shows the result of the British burning of Washington, DC.\\n AMERICANA\\nFrancis Scott Key’s “In Defense of Fort McHenry”\\nAfter the British bombed Baltimore’s Fort McHenry in 1814 but failed to overcome the U.S. forces there, Francis Scott Key was inspired by the sight of the American flag, which remained hanging proudly in the aftermath. He wrote the poem “In Defense of Fort McHenry,” which was later set to the tune of a British song called “The Anacreontic Song” and eventually became the U.S. national anthem, “The Star-Spangled Banner.”\\n Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,\\nWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming?\\n Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thru the perilous fight,\\nO’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?\\n And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there.\\n O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave\\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,\\nWhere the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,\\nWhat is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,\\nAs it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?\\nNow it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,\\nIn full glory reflected, now shines on the stream:\\nTis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave\\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave! And where is that band who so vauntingly swore\\nThat the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion\\nA home and a country should leave us no more?\\nTheir blood has washed out their foul footsteps’ pollution.\\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\\nFrom the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:\\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave\\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave. O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,\\nBetween their loved home and the war’s desolation!\\nBlest with victory and peace, may the heav’n-rescued land\\nPraise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!\\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\\nAnd this be our motto: “In God is our trust”\\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!\\n—Francis Scott Key, “In Defense of Fort McHenry,” 1814\\nWhat images does Key use to describe the American spirit? Most people are familiar with only the first verse of the song; what do you think the last three verses add?\\nCLICK AND EXPLORE\\nVisit the Smithsonian Institute to explore an interactive feature on the flag that inspired “The Star-Spangled Banner,” where clickable “hot spots” on the flag reveal elements of its history.\\nWith the end of the war in Europe, Britain was eager to end the conflict in the Americas as well. In 1814, British and U.S. diplomats met in Flanders, in northern Belgium, to negotiate the Treaty of Ghent, signed in December. The boundaries between the United States and British Canada remained as they were before the war, an outcome welcome to those in the United States who feared a rupture in the country’s otherwise steady expansion into the West.\\nThe War of 1812 was very unpopular in New England because it inflicted further economic harm on a region dependent on maritime commerce. This unpopularity caused a resurgence of the Federalist Party in New England. Many Federalists deeply resented the power of the slaveholding Virginians (Jefferson and then Madison), who appeared indifferent to their region. The depth of the Federalists’ discontent is illustrated by the proceedings of the December 1814 Hartford Convention, a meeting of twenty-six Federalists in Connecticut, where some attendees issued calls for New England to secede from the United States. These arguments for disunion during wartime, combined with the convention’s condemnation of the government, made Federalists appear unpatriotic. The convention forever discredited the Federalist Party and led to its downfall.\\nEPILOGUE: THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS\\nDue to slow communication, the last battle in the War of 1812 happened after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed ending the war. Andrew Jackson had distinguished himself in the war by defeating the Creek Natives in March 1814 before invading Florida in May of that year. After taking Pensacola, he moved his force of Tennessee fighters to New Orleans to defend the strategic port against British attack.\\nOn January 8, 1815 (despite the official end of the war), a force of battle-tested British veterans of the Napoleonic Wars attempted to take the port. Jackson’s forces devastated the British, killing over two thousand. New Orleans and the vast Mississippi River Valley had been successfully defended, ensuring the future of American settlement and commerce. The Battle of New Orleans immediately catapulted Jackson to national prominence as a war hero, and in the 1820s, he emerged as the head of the new Democratic Party.</chunk4>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYou are asked to write a main idea multiple-choice question based on an academic text summary provided by the user. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\nNOTE: The user may provide an already generated question with evaluations, in which case you should revise the provided question based on the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] and the evaluations.\\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are main idea questions?**\\nMain idea questions assess a student\\'s ability to identify the central point or primary argument of a text, passage, or section.\\nInstead of focusing on specific details, examples, or minor points, these questions target the big picture — what the author is fundamentally trying to convey.\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Carefully read the TEXT to understand its main idea.  \\nStep2: Write a clear question stem. Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\nIdentify the shared perceptions and ideals of each social class\\nAssess different social classes’ views of slavery\\n The profound economic changes sweeping the United States led to equally important social and cultural transformations. The formation of distinct classes, especially in the rapidly industrializing North, was one of the most striking developments. The unequal distribution of newly created wealth spurred new divisions along class lines. Each class had its own specific culture and views on the issue of slavery.\\n THE ECONOMIC ELITE\\nEconomic elites gained further social and political ascendance in the United States due to a fast-growing economy that enhanced their wealth and allowed distinctive social and cultural characteristics to develop among different economic groups. In the major northern cities of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, leading merchants formed an industrial capitalist elite. Many came from families that had been deeply engaged in colonial trade in tea, sugar, pepper, enslaved Africans, and other commodities and that were familiar with trade networks connecting the United States with Europe, the West Indies, and the Far East. These colonial merchants had passed their wealth to their children.\\n After the War of 1812, the new generation of merchants expanded their economic activities. They began to specialize in specific types of industry, spearheading the development of industrial capitalism based on factories they owned and on specific commercial services such as banking, insurance, and shipping. Junius Spencer Morgan (Figure 9.16), for example, rose to prominence as a banker. His success began in Boston, where he worked in the import business in the 1830s. He then formed a partnership with a London banker, George Peabody, and created Peabody, Morgan & Co. In 1864, he renamed the enterprise J. S. Morgan & Co. His son, J. P. Morgan, became a noted financier in the later nineteenth and early twentieth century.\\n A photograph of Junius Spencer Morgan is shown.\\n Figure 9.16 Junius Spencer Morgan of Boston was one of the fathers of the American private banking system. (credit: Project Gutenberg Archives)\\nCLICK AND EXPLORE\\nVisit the Internet Archive to see scanned pages from Hunt’s Merchant’s Magazine and Commercial Review. This monthly business review provided the business elite with important information about issues pertaining to trade and finance: commodity prices, new laws affecting business, statistics regarding imports and exports, and similar content. Choose three articles and decide how they might have been important to the northern business elite.\\n Members of the northern business elite forged close ties with each other to protect and expand their economic interests. Marriages between leading families formed a crucial strategy to advance economic advantage, and the homes of the northern elite became important venues for solidifying social bonds. Exclusive neighborhoods started to develop as the wealthy distanced themselves from the poorer urban residents, and cities soon became segregated by class.\\n Industrial elites created chambers of commerce to advance their interests; by 1858 there were ten in the United States. These networking organizations allowed top bankers and merchants to stay current on the economic activities of their peers and further strengthen the bonds among themselves.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>The elite also established social clubs to forge and maintain ties. The first of these, the Philadelphia Club, came into being in 1834. Similar clubs soon formed in other cities and hosted a range of social activities designed to further bind together the leading economic families. Many northern elites worked hard to ensure the transmission of their inherited wealth from one generation to the next. Politically, they exercised considerable power in local and state elections. Most also had ties to the cotton trade, so they were strong supporters of slavery.\\n The Industrial Revolution led some former artisans to reinvent themselves as manufacturers. These enterprising leaders of manufacturing differed from the established commercial elite in the North and South because they did not inherit wealth. Instead, many came from very humble working-class origins and embodied the dream of achieving upward social mobility through hard work and discipline. As the beneficiaries of the economic transformations sweeping the republic, these newly established manufacturers formed a new economic elite that thrived in the cities and cultivated its own distinct sensibilities. They created a culture that celebrated hard work, a position that put them at odds with southern planter elites who prized leisure and with other elite northerners who had largely inherited their wealth and status.\\n Peter Cooper provides one example of the new northern manufacturing class. Ever inventive, Cooper dabbled in many different moneymaking enterprises before gaining success in the glue business. He opened his Manhattan glue factory in the 1820s and was soon using his profits to expand into a host of other activities, including iron production. One of his innovations was the steam locomotive, which he invented in 1827 (Figure 9.17). Despite becoming one of the wealthiest men in New York City, Cooper lived simply. Rather than buying an ornate bed, for example, he built his own. He believed respectability came through hard work, not family pedigree.\\n A photograph of a replica of the Tom Thumb steam locomotive is shown. On its side are painted the words “Peter Cooper’s ‘Tom Thumb’ 1829–30 Baltimore and Ohio R.R.”\\nFigure 9.17 Peter Cooper, who would go on to found the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City, designed and built the Tom Thumb, the first American-built steam locomotive, a replica of which is shown here.\\n Those who had inherited their wealth derided self-made men like Cooper, and he and others like him were excluded from the social clubs established by the merchant and financial elite of New York City. Self-made northern manufacturers, however, created their own organizations that aimed to promote upward mobility. The Providence Association of Mechanics and Manufacturers was formed in 1789 and promoted both industrial arts and education as a pathway to economic success. In 1859, Peter Cooper established the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, a school in New York City dedicated to providing education in technology. Merit, not wealth, mattered most according to Cooper, and admission to the school was based solely on ability; race, sex, and family connections had no place. The best and brightest could attend Cooper Union tuition-free, a policy that remained in place until 2014.\\n</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>THE MIDDLE CLASS\\nNot all enterprising artisans were so successful that they could rise to the level of the elite. However, many artisans and small merchants, who owned small factories and stores, did manage to achieve and maintain respectability in an emerging middle class. Lacking the protection of great wealth, members of the middle class agonized over the fear that they might slip into the ranks of wage laborers; thus they strove to maintain or improve their middle-class status and that of their children.\\n To this end, the middle class valued cleanliness, discipline, morality, hard work, education, and good manners. Hard work and education enabled them to rise in life. Middle-class children, therefore, did not work in factories. Instead they attended school and in their free time engaged in “self-improving” activities, such as reading or playing the piano, or they played with toys and games that would teach them the skills and values they needed to succeed in life. In the early nineteenth century, members of the middle class began to limit the number of children they had. Children no longer contributed economically to the household, and raising them “correctly” required money and attention. It therefore made sense to have fewer of them.\\n Middle-class women did not work for wages. Their job was to care for the children and to keep the house in a state of order and cleanliness, often with the help of a servant. They also performed the important tasks of cultivating good manners among their children and their husbands and of purchasing consumer goods; both activities proclaimed to neighbors and prospective business partners that their families were educated, cultured, and financially successful.\\n Northern business elites, many of whom owned or had invested in businesses like cotton mills that profited from slave labor, often viewed the institution of slavery with ambivalence. Most members of the middle class took a dim view of it, however, since it promoted a culture of leisure. Slavery stood as the antithesis of the middle-class view that dignity and respectability were achieved through work, and many members of this class became active in efforts to end it.\\n This class of upwardly mobile citizens promoted temperance, or abstinence from alcohol. They also gave their support to Protestant ministers like Charles Grandison Finney, who preached that all people possessed free moral agency, meaning they could change their lives and bring about their own salvation, a message that resonated with members of the middle class, who already believed their worldly efforts had led to their economic success.\\n THE WORKING CLASS\\nThe Industrial Revolution in the United States created a new class of wage workers, and this working class also developed its own culture. They formed their own neighborhoods, living away from the oversight of bosses and managers. While industrialization and the market revolution brought some improvements to the lives of the working class, these sweeping changes did not benefit laborers as much as they did the middle class and the elites. The working class continued to live an often precarious existence. They suffered greatly during economic slumps, such as the Panic of 1819.\\n Although most working-class men sought to emulate the middle class by keeping their wives and children out of the work force, their economic situation often necessitated that others besides the male head of the family contribute to its support.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>Thus, working-class children might attend school for a few years or learn to read and write at Sunday school, but education was sacrificed when income was needed, and many working-class children went to work in factories. While the wives of wage laborers usually did not work for wages outside the home, many took in laundry or did piecework at home to supplement the family’s income.\\n Although the urban working class could not afford the consumer goods that the middle class could, its members did exercise a great deal of influence over popular culture. Theirs was a festive public culture of release and escape from the drudgery of factory work, catered to by the likes of Phineas Taylor Barnum, the celebrated circus promoter and showman. Taverns also served an important function as places to forget the long hours and uncertain wages of the factories. Alcohol consumption was high among the working class, although many workers did take part in the temperance movement. It is little wonder that middle-class manufacturers attempted to abolish alcohol.\\n AMERICANA\\nP. T. Barnum and the Feejee Mermaid\\nThe Connecticut native P. T. Barnum catered to the demand for escape and cheap amusements among the working class. His American Museum in New York City opened in 1841 and achieved great success. Millions flocked to see Barnum’s exhibits, which included a number of fantastic human and animal oddities, almost all of which were hoaxes. One exhibit in the 1840s featured the “Feejee Mermaid,” which Barnum presented as proof of the existence of the mythical mermaids of the deep (Figure 9.18). In truth, the mermaid was a half-monkey, half-fish stitched together.\\n Illustration (a) depicts a creature with the head and upper torso of a young monkey and the bottom half of a fish. Photograph (b) shows crowds of people surrounding P. T. Barnum’s American Museum in New York City.\\n Figure 9.18 Spurious though they were, attractions such as the Feejee mermaid (a) from P. T. Barnum’s American Museum in New York City (b) drew throngs of working-class wage earners in the middle of the nineteenth century.\\n CLICK AND EXPLORE\\nVisit The Lost Museum to take a virtual tour of P. T. Barnum’s incredible museum.\\n Wage workers in the North were largely hostile to the abolition of slavery, fearing it would unleash more competition for jobs from free Black people. Many were also hostile to immigration. The pace of immigration to the United States accelerated in the 1840s and 1850s as Europeans were drawn to the promise of employment and land in the United States. Many new members of the working class came from the ranks of these immigrants, who brought new foods, customs, and religions. The Roman Catholic population of the United States, fairly small before this period, began to swell with the arrival of the Irish and the Germans.</chunk4>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 0 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 0 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags. The answer should contain the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D) and the text of the correct answer. Example:\\n<ANSWER>A) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.</ANSWER>\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"<text>\\nThe section outlines the learning objectives for identifying perceptions and ideals of various social classes and their views on slavery.

These elites, often from families involved in colonial trade, extended their influence by forming industrial capitalism through factories, banking, insurance, and shipping. This group formed exclusive social circles and influenced local and state politics, maintaining strong ties to the cotton trade and slavery.

They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you should be able to:\\n•\\tRecall the 6 Steps of the Scientific Method\\n•\\tDifferentiate between four kinds of research methods: surveys, field research, experiments, and secondary data analysis.\\n •\\tExplain the appropriateness of specific research approaches for specific topics.\\n Sociologists examine the social world, see a problem or interesting pattern, and set out to study it. They use research methods to design a study. Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study. Sociologists generally choose from widely used methods of social investigation: primary source data collection such as survey, participant observation, ethnography, case study, unobtrusive observations, experiment, and secondary data analysis, or use of existing sources. Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use. When you are conducting research think about the best way to gather or obtain knowledge about your topic, think of yourself as an architect. An architect needs a blueprint to build a house, as a sociologist your blueprint is your research design including your data collection method.\\n When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being observed. A researcher wouldn’t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, “Any gang members around?”\\n Making sociologists’ presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers can’t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe behaviors or attract attention. In situations like these, other methods are needed. Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics, protect research participants or subjects, and that fit with their overall approaches to research.\\n Surveys\\nAs a research method, a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire or an interview. The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in which they can express personal ideas.\\n Figure 2.3 Questionnaires are a common research method. (Credit: CDC Global/flickr)\\n At some point, most people in the United States respond to some type of survey. The 2020 U.S. Census is an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Since 1790, United States has conducted a survey consisting of six questions to received demographical data pertaining to residents. The questions pertain to the demographics of the residents who live in the United States. Currently, the Census is received by residents in the United Stated and five territories and consists of 12 questions.\\n Not all surveys are considered sociological research, however, and many surveys people commonly encounter focus on identifying marketing needs and strategies rather than testing a hypothesis or contributing to social science knowledge.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Questions such as, “How many hot dogs do you eat in a month?” or “Were the staff helpful?” are not usually designed as scientific research. The Nielsen Ratings determine the popularity of television programming through scientific market research. However, polls conducted by television programs such as American Idol or So You Think You Can Dance cannot be generalized, because they are administered to an unrepresentative population, a specific show’s audience. You might receive polls through your cell phones or emails, from grocery stores, restaurants, and retail stores. They often provide you incentives for completing the survey.\\n Figure 2.4 Real-time surveys are common in classrooms, live-audience events, and even popular media. Twitter polls have often replaced physical devices such as the one pictured. (Credit: Sam Howzit/flickr)\\nSociologists conduct surveys under controlled conditions for specific purposes. Surveys gather different types of information from people. While surveys are not great at capturing the ways people really behave in social situations, they are a great method for discovering how people feel, think, and act—or at least how they say they feel, think, and act. Surveys can track preferences for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors (such as sleeping, driving, or texting habits) or information such as employment status, income, and education levels.\\n A survey targets a specific population, people who are the focus of a study, such as college athletes, international students, or teenagers living with type 1 (juvenile-onset) diabetes. Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population, or a sample, a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population. The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample. In a random sample, every person in a population has the same chance of being chosen for the study. As a result, a Gallup Poll, if conducted as a nationwide random sampling, should be able to provide an accurate estimate of public opinion whether it contacts 2,000 or 10,000 people.\\n After selecting subjects, the researcher develops a specific plan to ask questions and record responses. It is important to inform subjects of the nature and purpose of the survey up front. If they agree to participate, researchers thank subjects and offer them a chance to see the results of the study if they are interested. The researcher presents the subjects with an instrument, which is a means of gathering the information.\\n A common instrument is a questionnaire. Subjects often answer a series of closed-ended questions. The researcher might ask yes-or-no or multiple-choice questions, allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question. This kind of questionnaire collects quantitative data—data in numerical form that can be counted and statistically analyzed. Just count up the number of “yes” and “no” responses or correct answers, and chart them into percentages.\\n Questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers—beyond “yes,” “no,” or checkbox options. These types of inquiries use open-ended questions that require short essay responses.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Participants willing to take the time to write those answers might convey personal religious beliefs, political views, goals, or morals. The answers are subjective and vary from person to person. How do you plan to use your college education?\\n Some topics that investigate internal thought processes are impossible to observe directly and are difficult to discuss honestly in a public forum. People are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously. This type of personal explanation is qualitative data—conveyed through words. Qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate. The researcher will end up with a wide range of responses, some of which may be surprising. The benefit of written opinions, though, is the wealth of in-depth material that they provide.\\n An interview is a one-on-one conversation between the researcher and the subject, and it is a way of conducting surveys on a topic. However, participants are free to respond as they wish, without being limited by predetermined choices. In the back-and-forth conversation of an interview, a researcher can ask for clarification, spend more time on a subtopic, or ask additional questions. In an interview, a subject will ideally feel free to open up and answer questions that are often complex. There are no right or wrong answers. The subject might not even know how to answer the questions honestly.\\n Questions such as “How does society’s view of alcohol consumption influence your decision whether or not to take your first sip of alcohol?” or “Did you feel that the divorce of your parents would put a social stigma on your family?” involve so many factors that the answers are difficult to categorize. A researcher needs to avoid steering or prompting the subject to respond in a specific way; otherwise, the results will prove to be unreliable. The researcher will also benefit from gaining a subject’s trust, from empathizing or commiserating with a subject, and from listening without judgment.\\n Surveys often collect both quantitative and qualitative data. For example, a researcher interviewing people who are incarcerated might receive quantitative data, such as demographics – race, age, sex, that can be analyzed statistically. For example, the researcher might discover that 20 percent of incarcerated people are above the age of 50. The researcher might also collect qualitative data, such as why people take advantage of educational opportunities during their sentence and other explanatory information.\\n The survey can be carried out online, over the phone, by mail, or face-to-face. When researchers collect data outside a laboratory, library, or workplace setting, they are conducting field research, which is our next topic.\\n Field Research\\nThe work of sociology rarely happens in limited, confined spaces. Rather, sociologists go out into the world. They meet subjects where they live, work, and play. Field research refers to gathering primary data from a natural environment. To conduct field research, the sociologist must be willing to step into new environments and observe, participate, or experience those worlds. In field work, the sociologists, rather than the subjects, are the ones out of their element.\\n</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>The researcher interacts with or observes people and gathers data along the way. The key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject’s natural environment, whether it’s a coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.\\n Figure 2.5 Sociological researchers travel across countries and cultures to interact with and observe subjects in their natural environments. (Credit: IMLS Digital Collections and Content/flickr)\\n While field research often begins in a specific setting, the study’s purpose is to observe specific behaviors in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing how people think and behave. It seeks to understand why they behave that way. However, researchers may struggle to narrow down cause and effect when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment. And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables. Indeed, much of the data gathered in sociology do not identify a cause and effect but a correlation.\\n Figure 2.6 Researchers have used surveys and participant observations to accumulate data on Lady Gaga and Beyonce as multifaceted performers. (Credit a: John Robert Chartlon/flickr, b: Kristopher Harris/flickr.)\\n Sociologists have studied Lady Gaga and Beyoncé and their impact on music, movies, social media, fan participation, and social equality. In their studies, researchers have used several research methods including secondary analysis, participant observation, and surveys from concert participants.\\n In their study, Click, Lee & Holiday (2013) interviewed 45 Lady Gaga fans who utilized social media to communicate with the artist. These fans viewed Lady Gaga as a mirror of themselves and a source of inspiration. Like her, they embrace not being a part of mainstream culture. Many of Lady Gaga’s fans are members of the LGBTQ community. They see the “song “Born This Way” as a rallying cry and answer her calls for “Paws Up” with a physical expression of solidarity—outstretched arms and ﬁngers bent and curled to resemble monster claws.”\\n Sascha Buchanan (2019) made use of participant observation to study the relationship between two fan groups, that of Beyoncé and that of Rihanna. She observed award shows sponsored by iHeartRadio, MTV EMA, and BET that pit one group against another as they competed for Best Fan Army, Biggest Fans, and FANdemonium. Buchanan argues that the media thus sustains a myth of rivalry between the two most commercially successful Black women vocal artists.</chunk4>\\n\\n<chunk5>\\nParticipant Observation\\nIn 2000, a comic writer named Rodney Rothman wanted an insider’s view of white-collar work. He slipped into the sterile, high-rise offices of a New York “dot com” agency. Every day for two weeks, he pretended to work there. His main purpose was simply to see whether anyone would notice him or challenge his presence. No one did. The receptionist greeted him. The employees smiled and said good morning. Rothman was accepted as part of the team. He even went so far as to claim a desk, inform the receptionist of his whereabouts, and attend a meeting. He published an article about his experience in The New Yorker called “My Fake Job” (2000). Later, he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology. However, Rothman’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “dot com” company and exemplified the lengths to which a writer, or a sociologist, will go to uncover material.\\n Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation, in which researchers join people and participate in a group’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context. This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life. A researcher might go to great lengths to get a firsthand look into a trend, institution, or behavior. A researcher might work as a waitress in a diner, experience homelessness for several weeks, or ride along with police officers as they patrol their regular beat. Often, these researchers try to blend in seamlessly with the population they study, and they may not disclose their true identity or purpose if they feel it would compromise the results of their research.\\n Figure 2.7 Is she a working waitress or a sociologist conducting a study using participant observation? A field researcher may take a job or take other steps to get firsthand knowledge of their subjects. (Credit: Gareth Williams/flickr.)\\n At the beginning of a field study, researchers might have a question: “What really goes on in the kitchen of the most popular diner on campus?” or “What is it like to be homeless?” Participant observation is a useful method if the researcher wants to explore a certain environment from the inside.\\n Field researchers simply want to observe and learn. In such a setting, the researcher will be alert and open minded to whatever happens, recording all observations accurately. Soon, as patterns emerge, questions will become more specific, observations will lead to hypotheses, and hypotheses will guide the researcher in analyzing data and generating results.\\n In a study of small towns in the United States conducted by sociological researchers John S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd, the team altered their purpose as they gathered data. They initially planned to focus their study on the role of religion in U.S. towns. As they gathered observations, they realized that the effect of industrialization and urbanization was the more relevant topic of this social group. The Lynds did not change their methods, but they revised the purpose of their study.\\n</chunk5>\\n\\n<chunk6>This shaped the structure of Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture, their published results (Lynd & Lynd, 1929).\\n The Lynds were upfront about their mission. The townspeople of Muncie, Indiana, knew why the researchers were in their midst. But some sociologists prefer not to alert people to their presence. The main advantage of covert participant observation is that it allows the researcher access to authentic, natural behaviors of a group’s members. The challenge, however, is gaining access to a setting without disrupting the pattern of others’ behavior. Becoming an inside member of a group, organization, or subculture takes time and effort. Researchers must pretend to be something they are not. The process could involve role playing, making contacts, networking, or applying for a job.\\n Once inside a group, some researchers spend months or even years pretending to be one of the people they are observing. However, as observers, they cannot get too involved. They must keep their purpose in mind and apply the sociological perspective. That way, they illuminate social patterns that are often unrecognized. Because information gathered during participant observation is mostly qualitative, rather than quantitative, the end results are often descriptive or interpretive. The researcher might present findings in an article or book and describe what he or she witnessed and experienced.\\n This type of research is what journalist Barbara Ehrenreich conducted for her book Nickel and Dimed. One day over lunch with her editor, Ehrenreich mentioned an idea. How can people exist on minimum-wage work? How do low-income workers get by? she wondered. Someone should do a study. To her surprise, her editor responded, Why don’t you do it?\\n That’s how Ehrenreich found herself joining the ranks of the working class. For several months, she left her comfortable home and lived and worked among people who lacked, for the most part, higher education and marketable job skills. Undercover, she applied for and worked minimum wage jobs as a waitress, a cleaning woman, a nursing home aide, and a retail chain employee. During her participant observation, she used only her income from those jobs to pay for food, clothing, transportation, and shelter.\\n She discovered the obvious, that it’s almost impossible to get by on minimum wage work. She also experienced and observed attitudes many middle and upper-class people never think about. She witnessed firsthand the treatment of working class employees. She saw the extreme measures people take to make ends meet and to survive. She described fellow employees who held two or three jobs, worked seven days a week, lived in cars, could not pay to treat chronic health conditions, got randomly fired, submitted to drug tests, and moved in and out of homeless shelters. She brought aspects of that life to light, describing difficult working conditions and the poor treatment that low-wage workers suffer.\\n The book she wrote upon her return to her real life as a well-paid writer, has been widely read and used in many college classrooms.\\n Figure 2.8 Field research happens in real locations.</chunk6>\\n\\n<chunk7>What type of environment do work spaces foster? What would a sociologist discover after blending in? (Credit: Lyncconf Games/flickr)\\n Ethnography\\nEthnography is the immersion of the researcher in the natural setting of an entire social community to observe and experience their everyday life and culture. The heart of an ethnographic study focuses on how subjects view their own social standing and how they understand themselves in relation to a social group.\\n An ethnographic study might observe, for example, a small U.S. fishing town, an Inuit community, a village in Thailand, a Buddhist monastery, a private boarding school, or an amusement park. These places all have borders. People live, work, study, or vacation within those borders. People are there for a certain reason and therefore behave in certain ways and respect certain cultural norms. An ethnographer would commit to spending a determined amount of time studying every aspect of the chosen place, taking in as much as possible.\\n A sociologist studying a tribe in the Amazon might watch the way villagers go about their daily lives and then write a paper about it. To observe a spiritual retreat center, an ethnographer might sign up for a retreat and attend as a guest for an extended stay, observe and record data, and collate the material into results.\\n Institutional Ethnography\\nInstitutional ethnography is an extension of basic ethnographic research principles that focuses intentionally on everyday concrete social relationships. Developed by Canadian sociologist Dorothy E. Smith (1990), institutional ethnography is often considered a feminist-inspired approach to social analysis and primarily considers women’s experiences within male- dominated societies and power structures. Smith’s work is seen to challenge sociology’s exclusion of women, both academically and in the study of women’s lives (Fenstermaker, n.d.).\\n Historically, social science research tended to objectify women and ignore their experiences except as viewed from the male perspective. Modern feminists note that describing women, and other marginalized groups, as subordinates helps those in authority maintain their own dominant positions (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada n.d.). Smith’s three major works explored what she called “the conceptual practices of power” and are still considered seminal works in feminist theory and ethnography (Fensternmaker n.d.).\\n SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH\\nThe Making of Middletown: A Study in Modern U.S. Culture\\nIn 1924, a young married couple named Robert and Helen Lynd undertook an unprecedented ethnography: to apply sociological methods to the study of one U.S. city in order to discover what “ordinary” people in the United States did and believed. Choosing Muncie, Indiana (population about 30,000) as their subject, they moved to the small town and lived there for eighteen months.\\n Ethnographers had been examining other cultures for decades—groups considered minorities or outsiders—like gangs, immigrants, and the poor. But no one had studied the so-called average American.\\n Recording interviews and using surveys to gather data, the Lynds objectively described what they observed. Researching existing sources, they compared Muncie in 1890 to the Muncie they observed in 1924. Most Muncie adults, they found, had grown up on farms but now lived in homes inside the city.</chunk7>\\n\\n<chunk8>As a result, the Lynds focused their study on the impact of industrialization and urbanization.\\n They observed that Muncie was divided into business and working class groups. They defined business class as dealing with abstract concepts and symbols, while working class people used tools to create concrete objects. The two classes led different lives with different goals and hopes. However, the Lynds observed, mass production offered both classes the same amenities. Like wealthy families, the working class was now able to own radios, cars, washing machines, telephones, vacuum cleaners, and refrigerators. This was an emerging material reality of the 1920s.\\n As the Lynds worked, they divided their manuscript into six chapters: Getting a Living, Making a Home, Training the Young, Using Leisure, Engaging in Religious Practices, and Engaging in Community Activities.\\n When the study was completed, the Lynds encountered a big problem. The Rockefeller Foundation, which had commissioned the book, claimed it was useless and refused to publish it. The Lynds asked if they could seek a publisher themselves.\\n Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture was not only published in 1929 but also became an instant bestseller, a status unheard of for a sociological study. The book sold out six printings in its first year of publication, and has never gone out of print (Caplow, Hicks, & Wattenberg. 2000).\\n Nothing like it had ever been done before. Middletown was reviewed on the front page of the New York Times. Readers in the 1920s and 1930s identified with the citizens of Muncie, Indiana, but they were equally fascinated by the sociological methods and the use of scientific data to define ordinary people in the United States. The book was proof that social data was important—and interesting—to the U.S.\\nFigure 2.9 A classroom in Muncie, Indiana, in 1917, five years before John and Helen Lynd began researching this “typical” U.S. community. (Credit: Don O’Brien/flickr)\\n Case Study\\nSometimes a researcher wants to study one specific person or event. A case study is an in-depth analysis of a single event, situation, or individual. To conduct a case study, a researcher examines existing sources like documents and archival records, conducts interviews, engages in direct observation and even participant observation, if possible.\\n Researchers might use this method to study a single case of a foster child, drug lord, cancer patient, criminal, or rape victim. However, a major criticism of the case study as a method is that while offering depth on a topic, it does not provide enough evidence to form a generalized conclusion. In other words, it is difficult to make universal claims based on just one person, since one person does not verify a pattern. This is why most sociologists do not use case studies as a primary research method.\\n However, case studies are useful when the single case is unique. In these instances, a single case study can contribute tremendous insight. For example, a feral child, also called “wild child,” is one who grows up isolated from human beings.</chunk8>\\n\\n<chunk9>Feral children grow up without social contact and language, which are elements crucial to a “civilized” child’s development. These children mimic the behaviors and movements of animals, and often invent their own language. There are only about one hundred cases of “feral children” in the world.\\n As you may imagine, a feral child is a subject of great interest to researchers. Feral children provide unique information about child development because they have grown up outside of the parameters of “normal” growth and nurturing. And since there are very few feral children, the case study is the most appropriate method for researchers to use in studying the subject.\\n At age three, a Ukranian girl named Oxana Malaya suffered severe parental neglect. She lived in a shed with dogs, and she ate raw meat and scraps. Five years later, a neighbor called authorities and reported seeing a girl who ran on all fours, barking. Officials brought Oxana into society, where she was cared for and taught some human behaviors, but she never became fully socialized. She has been designated as unable to support herself and now lives in a mental institution (Grice 2011). Case studies like this offer a way for sociologists to collect data that may not be obtained by any other method.\\n Experiments\\nYou have probably tested some of your own personal social theories. “If I study at night and review in the morning, I’ll improve my retention skills.” Or, “If I stop drinking soda, I’ll feel better.” Cause and effect. If this, then that. When you test the theory, your results either prove or disprove your hypothesis.\\n One way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment, meaning they investigate relationships to test a hypothesis—a scientific approach.\\n There are two main types of experiments: lab-based experiments and natural or field experiments. In a lab setting, the research can be controlled so that more data can be recorded in a limited amount of time. In a natural or field- based experiment, the time it takes to gather the data cannot be controlled but the information might be considered more accurate since it was collected without interference or intervention by the researcher.\\n As a research method, either type of sociological experiment is useful for testing if-then statements: if a particular thing happens (cause), then another particular thing will result (effect). To set up a lab-based experiment, sociologists create artificial situations that allow them to manipulate variables.\\n Classically, the sociologist selects a set of people with similar characteristics, such as age, class, race, or education. Those people are divided into two groups. One is the experimental group and the other is the control group. The experimental group is exposed to the independent variable(s) and the control group is not. To test the benefits of tutoring, for example, the sociologist might provide tutoring to the experimental group of students but not to the control group. Then both groups would be tested for differences in performance to see if tutoring had an effect on the experimental group of students.</chunk9>\\n\\n<chunk10>As you can imagine, in a case like this, the researcher would not want to jeopardize the accomplishments of either group of students, so the setting would be somewhat artificial. The test would not be for a grade reflected on their permanent record of a student, for example.\\n And if a researcher told the students they would be observed as part of a study on measuring the effectiveness of tutoring, the students might not behave naturally. This is called the Hawthorne effect—which occurs when people change their behavior because they know they are being watched as part of a study. The Hawthorne effect is unavoidable in some research studies because sociologists have to make the purpose of the study known. Subjects must be aware that they are being observed, and a certain amount of artificiality may result (Sonnenfeld 1985).\\n Figure 2.10 Sociologist Frances Heussenstamm conducted research to explore the correlation between traffic stops and race-based bumper stickers. This issue of racial profiling remains a hot-button topic today. (Credit: dwightsghost/flickr)\\n A real-life example will help illustrate the process. In 1971, Frances Heussenstamm, a sociology professor at California State University at Los Angeles, had a theory about police prejudice. To test her theory, she conducted research. She chose fifteen students from three ethnic backgrounds: Black, White, and Hispanic. She chose students who routinely drove to and from campus along Los Angeles freeway routes, and who had had perfect driving records for longer than a year.\\n Next, she placed a Black Panther bumper sticker on each car. That sticker, a representation of a social value, was the independent variable. In the 1970s, the Black Panthers were a revolutionary group actively fighting racism. Heussenstamm asked the students to follow their normal driving patterns. She wanted to see whether seeming support for the Black Panthers would change how these good drivers were treated by the police patrolling the highways. The dependent variable would be the number of traffic stops/citations.\\n The first arrest, for an incorrect lane change, was made two hours after the experiment began. One participant was pulled over three times in three days. He quit the study. After seventeen days, the fifteen drivers had collected a total of thirty-three traffic citations. The research was halted. The funding to pay traffic fines had run out, and so had the enthusiasm of the participants (Heussenstamm, 1971).\\n Secondary Data Analysis\\nWhile sociologists often engage in original research studies, they also contribute knowledge to the discipline through secondary data analysis. Secondary data does not result from firsthand research collected from primary sources, but are the already completed work of other researchers or data collected by an agency or organization. Sociologists might study works written by historians, economists, teachers, or early sociologists. They might search through periodicals, newspapers, or magazines, or organizational data from any period in history.\\n Using available information not only saves time and money but can also add depth to a study. Sociologists often interpret findings in a new way, a way that was not part of an author’s original purpose or intention.</chunk10>\\n\\n<chunk11>To study how women were encouraged to act and behave in the 1960s, for example, a researcher might watch movies, televisions shows, and situation comedies from that period. Or to research changes in behavior and attitudes due to the emergence of television in the late 1950s and early 1960s, a sociologist would rely on new interpretations of secondary data. Decades from now, researchers will most likely conduct similar studies on the advent of mobile phones, the Internet, or social media.\\n Social scientists also learn by analyzing the research of a variety of agencies. Governmental departments and global groups, like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or the World Health Organization (WHO), publish studies with findings that are useful to sociologists. A public statistic like the foreclosure rate might be useful for studying the effects of a recession. A racial demographic profile might be compared with data on education funding to examine the resources accessible by different groups.\\n One of the advantages of secondary data like old movies or WHO statistics is that it is nonreactive research (or unobtrusive research), meaning that it does not involve direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people’s behaviors. Unlike studies requiring direct contact with people, using previously published data does not require entering a population and the investment and risks inherent in that research process.\\n Using available data does have its challenges. Public records are not always easy to access. A researcher will need to do some legwork to track them down and gain access to records. To guide the search through a vast library of materials and avoid wasting time reading unrelated sources, sociologists employ content analysis, applying a systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from secondary data as they relate to the study at hand.\\n Also, in some cases, there is no way to verify the accuracy of existing data. It is easy to count how many drunk drivers, for example, are pulled over by the police. But how many are not? While it’s possible to discover the percentage of teenage students who drop out of high school, it might be more challenging to determine the number who return to school or get their GED later.\\n Another problem arises when data are unavailable in the exact form needed or do not survey the topic from the precise angle the researcher seeks. For example, the average salaries paid to professors at a public school is public record. But these figures do not necessarily reveal how long it took each professor to reach the salary range, what their educational backgrounds are, or how long they’ve been teaching.\\n When conducting content analysis, it is important to consider the date of publication of an existing source and to take into account attitudes and common cultural ideals that may have influenced the research. For example, when Robert S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd gathered research in the 1920s, attitudes and cultural norms were vastly different then than they are now. Beliefs about gender roles, race, education, and work have changed significantly since then. At the time, the study’s purpose was to reveal insights about small U.S. communities. Today, it is an illustration of 1920s attitudes and values.</chunk11>\\n\\n<chunk12></chunk12>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 1 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 1 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

They use research methods to design a study. Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study. Sociologists generally choose from widely used methods of social investigation: primary source data collection such as survey, participant observation, ethnography, case study, unobtrusive observations, experiment, and secondary data analysis, or use of existing sources. Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use. When you are conducting research think about the best way to gather or obtain knowledge about your topic, think of yourself as an architect. An architect needs a blueprint to build a house, as a sociologist your blueprint is your research design including your data collection method.\\n When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being observed. A researcher wouldn’t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, “Any gang members around?”\\n Making sociologists’ presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers can’t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe behaviors or attract attention. In situations like these, other methods are needed. Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics, protect research participants or subjects, and that fit with their overall approaches to research.\\n Surveys\\nAs a research method, a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire or an interview. The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in which they can express personal ideas.\\n Figure 2.3 Questionnaires are a common research method. (Credit: CDC Global/flickr)\\n At some point, most people in the United States respond to some type of survey. The 2020 U.S. Census is an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Since 1790, United States has conducted a survey consisting of six questions to received demographical data pertaining to residents. The questions pertain to the demographics of the residents who live in the United States. Currently, the Census is received by residents in the United Stated and five territories and consists of 12 questions.\\n Not all surveys are considered sociological research, however, and many surveys people commonly encounter focus on identifying marketing needs and strategies rather than testing a hypothesis or contributing to social science knowledge.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nIt discusses surveys and their limitations in accurately capturing human behavior, emphasizing the importance of representative samples for valid results. Sociologists use surveys under controlled conditions to gain insights into how people express their feelings and actions. The random sampling process is crucial for predicting accurate public opinions in such studies. Surveys yield both quantitative and qualitative data. Interviews can capture subjective, in-depth responses to complex questions, but researchers must avoid influencing subjects' answers to ensure reliable results. Field research involves gathering data outside controlled environments, highlighting the challenges in establishing causal relationships between observed variables. Field research takes place in subjects' natural settings. It examines behaviors, though it cannot determine causality due to natural variables. Case studies on public figures like Lady Gaga and Beyoncé illustrate varied sociological methods used to gather insights on cultural impact. Participant observation is explained through the example of Rodney Rothman, who integrated himself into a workplace setting to observe social dynamics. This technique provides insight into specific social experiences, though it requires the researcher to blend seamlessly into the studied population. Participant observation allows understanding of social life from an insider's perspective, as demonstrated by Barbara Ehrenreich's exploration of minimum-wage workers' lives. Researchers maintain objectivity while immersing themselves in subjects' environments. Ethnography involves immersive observation within social communities to understand cultural dynamics. Institutional ethnography highlights social structures and power dynamics, focusing on documenting ordinary people’s lives within societies. The classic study by the Lynds in Muncie, Indiana, exemplifies this method, focusing on the impact of societal changes on community life. The Lynds' study demonstrated the socioeconomic changes and similarities between classes in Muncie and remains relevant for its sociological insights. The book 'Middletown' was a success despite initial publication roadblocks. Case studies provide detailed, though not generalizable, insights into unique situations, such as studying feral children to understand development outside typical societal structures. Experiments test hypotheses under controlled or natural settings, highlighting cause-effect relationships. Sociologists often create circumstances to isolate variables, ensuring experimental objectivity and integrity. The Hawthorne effect is a challenge in experiments, where awareness of observation alters subjects’ behavior. Experiments must minimize this effect to observe true behavior for reliable hypothesis testing. Secondary data analysis involves using existing data to draw new insights and findings, offering time and cost savings. It's crucial to verify the adequacy of data with contemporary standards and be mindful of historical context when analyzing older data. [Empty Chunk]\\n</contextual_text>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

The answers are subjective and vary from person to person. How do you plan to use your college education?\\n Some topics that investigate internal thought processes are impossible to observe directly and are difficult to discuss honestly in a public forum. People are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously. This type of personal explanation is qualitative data—conveyed through words. Qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate. The researcher will end up with a wide range of responses, some of which may be surprising. The benefit of written opinions, though, is the wealth of in-depth material that they provide.\\n An interview is a one-on-one conversation between the researcher and the subject, and it is a way of conducting surveys on a topic. However, participants are free to respond as they wish, without being limited by predetermined choices. In the back-and-forth conversation of an interview, a researcher can ask for clarification, spend more time on a subtopic, or ask additional questions. In an interview, a subject will ideally feel free to open up and answer questions that are often complex. There are no right or wrong answers. The subject might not even know how to answer the questions honestly.\\n Questions such as “How does society’s view of alcohol consumption influence your decision whether or not to take your first sip of alcohol?” or “Did you feel that the divorce of your parents would put a social stigma on your family?” involve so many factors that the answers are difficult to categorize. A researcher needs to avoid steering or prompting the subject to respond in a specific way; otherwise, the results will prove to be unreliable. The researcher will also benefit from gaining a subject’s trust, from empathizing or commiserating with a subject, and from listening without judgment.\\n Surveys often collect both quantitative and qualitative data. For example, a researcher interviewing people who are incarcerated might receive quantitative data, such as demographics – race, age, sex, that can be analyzed statistically. For example, the researcher might discover that 20 percent of incarcerated people are above the age of 50. The researcher might also collect qualitative data, such as why people take advantage of educational opportunities during their sentence and other explanatory information.\\n The survey can be carried out online, over the phone, by mail, or face-to-face. When researchers collect data outside a laboratory, library, or workplace setting, they are conducting field research, which is our next topic.\\n Field Research\\nThe work of sociology rarely happens in limited, confined spaces. Rather, sociologists go out into the world. They meet subjects where they live, work, and play. Field research refers to gathering primary data from a natural environment. To conduct field research, the sociologist must be willing to step into new environments and observe, participate, or experience those worlds. In field work, the sociologists, rather than the subjects, are the ones out of their element.\\nThe researcher interacts with or observes people and gathers data along the way. The key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject’s natural environment, whether it’s a coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.\\n Figure 2.5 Sociological researchers travel across countries and cultures to interact with and observe subjects in their natural environments. (Credit: IMLS Digital Collections and Content/flickr)\\n While field research often begins in a specific setting, the study’s purpose is to observe specific behaviors in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing how people think and behave. It seeks to understand why they behave that way. However, researchers may struggle to narrow down cause and effect when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment. And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables. Indeed, much of the data gathered in sociology do not identify a cause and effect but a correlation.\\n Figure 2.6 Researchers have used surveys and participant observations to accumulate data on Lady Gaga and Beyonce as multifaceted performers. (Credit a: John Robert Chartlon/flickr, b: Kristopher Harris/flickr.)\\n Sociologists have studied Lady Gaga and Beyoncé and their impact on music, movies, social media, fan participation, and social equality. In their studies, researchers have used several research methods including secondary analysis, participant observation, and surveys from concert participants.\\n In their study, Click, Lee & Holiday (2013) interviewed 45 Lady Gaga fans who utilized social media to communicate with the artist. These fans viewed Lady Gaga as a mirror of themselves and a source of inspiration. Like her, they embrace not being a part of mainstream culture. Many of Lady Gaga’s fans are members of the LGBTQ community. They see the “song “Born This Way” as a rallying cry and answer her calls for “Paws Up” with a physical expression of solidarity—outstretched arms and ﬁngers bent and curled to resemble monster claws.”\\n Sascha Buchanan (2019) made use of participant observation to study the relationship between two fan groups, that of Beyoncé and that of Rihanna. She observed award shows sponsored by iHeartRadio, MTV EMA, and BET that pit one group against another as they competed for Best Fan Army, Biggest Fans, and FANdemonium. Buchanan argues that the media thus sustains a myth of rivalry between the two most commercially successful Black women vocal artists.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nThis section outlines the learning objectives for understanding the scientific method and research methods in sociology. It highlights how sociologists study social patterns and apply various research methods depending on the topic. These methods do not always allow for complete anonymity and must be selected based on the research's goals and context. Surveys, for example, can provide anonymity and data helpful for identifying opinions and behaviors.

You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYou are asked to write a main idea multiple-choice question based on an academic text summary provided by the user. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\nNOTE: The user may provide an already generated question with evaluations, in which case you should revise the provided question based on the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] and the evaluations.\\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are main idea questions?**\\nMain idea questions assess a student\\'s ability to identify the central point or primary argument of a text, passage, or section.\\nInstead of focusing on specific details, examples, or minor points, these questions target the big picture — what the author is fundamentally trying to convey.\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Carefully read the TEXT to understand its main idea.  \\nStep2: Write a clear question stem. Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags.

They use research methods to design a study. Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study. Sociologists generally choose from widely used methods of social investigation: primary source data collection such as survey, participant observation, ethnography, case study, unobtrusive observations, experiment, and secondary data analysis, or use of existing sources. Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use. When you are conducting research think about the best way to gather or obtain knowledge about your topic, think of yourself as an architect. An architect needs a blueprint to build a house, as a sociologist your blueprint is your research design including your data collection method.\\n When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being observed. A researcher wouldn’t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, “Any gang members around?”\\n Making sociologists’ presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers can’t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe behaviors or attract attention. In situations like these, other methods are needed. Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics, protect research participants or subjects, and that fit with their overall approaches to research.\\n Surveys\\nAs a research method, a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire or an interview. The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in which they can express personal ideas.\\n Figure 2.3 Questionnaires are a common research method. (Credit: CDC Global/flickr)\\n At some point, most people in the United States respond to some type of survey. The 2020 U.S. Census is an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Since 1790, United States has conducted a survey consisting of six questions to received demographical data pertaining to residents. The questions pertain to the demographics of the residents who live in the United States. Currently, the Census is received by residents in the United Stated and five territories and consists of 12 questions.\\n Not all surveys are considered sociological research, however, and many surveys people commonly encounter focus on identifying marketing needs and strategies rather than testing a hypothesis or contributing to social science knowledge.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\nIt discusses surveys and their limitations in accurately capturing human behavior, emphasizing the importance of representative samples for valid results. Sociologists use surveys under controlled conditions to gain insights into how people express their feelings and actions. The random sampling process is crucial for predicting accurate public opinions in such studies. Surveys yield both quantitative and qualitative data. Interviews can capture subjective, in-depth responses to complex questions, but researchers must avoid influencing subjects' answers to ensure reliable results. Field research involves gathering data outside controlled environments, highlighting the challenges in establishing causal relationships between observed variables. Field research takes place in subjects' natural settings. It examines behaviors, though it cannot determine causality due to natural variables. Case studies on public figures like Lady Gaga and Beyoncé illustrate varied sociological methods used to gather insights on cultural impact. Participant observation is explained through the example of Rodney Rothman, who integrated himself into a workplace setting to observe social dynamics. This technique provides insight into specific social experiences, though it requires the researcher to blend seamlessly into the studied population. Participant observation allows understanding of social life from an insider's perspective, as demonstrated by Barbara Ehrenreich's exploration of minimum-wage workers' lives. Researchers maintain objectivity while immersing themselves in subjects' environments. Ethnography involves immersive observation within social communities to understand cultural dynamics. Institutional ethnography highlights social structures and power dynamics, focusing on documenting ordinary people’s lives within societies. The classic study by the Lynds in Muncie, Indiana, exemplifies this method, focusing on the impact of societal changes on community life. The Lynds' study demonstrated the socioeconomic changes and similarities between classes in Muncie and remains relevant for its sociological insights. The book 'Middletown' was a success despite initial publication roadblocks. Case studies provide detailed, though not generalizable, insights into unique situations, such as studying feral children to understand development outside typical societal structures. Experiments test hypotheses under controlled or natural settings, highlighting cause-effect relationships. Sociologists often create circumstances to isolate variables, ensuring experimental objectivity and integrity. The Hawthorne effect is a challenge in experiments, where awareness of observation alters subjects’ behavior. Experiments must minimize this effect to observe true behavior for reliable hypothesis testing. Secondary data analysis involves using existing data to draw new insights and findings, offering time and cost savings. It's crucial to verify the adequacy of data with contemporary standards and be mindful of historical context when analyzing older data. [Empty Chunk]\\n</contextual_text>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

The answers are subjective and vary from person to person. How do you plan to use your college education?\\n Some topics that investigate internal thought processes are impossible to observe directly and are difficult to discuss honestly in a public forum. People are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously. This type of personal explanation is qualitative data—conveyed through words. Qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate. The researcher will end up with a wide range of responses, some of which may be surprising. The benefit of written opinions, though, is the wealth of in-depth material that they provide.\\n An interview is a one-on-one conversation between the researcher and the subject, and it is a way of conducting surveys on a topic. However, participants are free to respond as they wish, without being limited by predetermined choices. In the back-and-forth conversation of an interview, a researcher can ask for clarification, spend more time on a subtopic, or ask additional questions. In an interview, a subject will ideally feel free to open up and answer questions that are often complex. There are no right or wrong answers. The subject might not even know how to answer the questions honestly.\\n Questions such as “How does society’s view of alcohol consumption influence your decision whether or not to take your first sip of alcohol?” or “Did you feel that the divorce of your parents would put a social stigma on your family?” involve so many factors that the answers are difficult to categorize. A researcher needs to avoid steering or prompting the subject to respond in a specific way; otherwise, the results will prove to be unreliable. The researcher will also benefit from gaining a subject’s trust, from empathizing or commiserating with a subject, and from listening without judgment.\\n Surveys often collect both quantitative and qualitative data. For example, a researcher interviewing people who are incarcerated might receive quantitative data, such as demographics – race, age, sex, that can be analyzed statistically. For example, the researcher might discover that 20 percent of incarcerated people are above the age of 50. The researcher might also collect qualitative data, such as why people take advantage of educational opportunities during their sentence and other explanatory information.\\n The survey can be carried out online, over the phone, by mail, or face-to-face. When researchers collect data outside a laboratory, library, or workplace setting, they are conducting field research, which is our next topic.\\n Field Research\\nThe work of sociology rarely happens in limited, confined spaces. Rather, sociologists go out into the world. They meet subjects where they live, work, and play. Field research refers to gathering primary data from a natural environment. To conduct field research, the sociologist must be willing to step into new environments and observe, participate, or experience those worlds. In field work, the sociologists, rather than the subjects, are the ones out of their element.\\nThe researcher interacts with or observes people and gathers data along the way. The key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject’s natural environment, whether it’s a coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.\\n Figure 2.5 Sociological researchers travel across countries and cultures to interact with and observe subjects in their natural environments. (Credit: IMLS Digital Collections and Content/flickr)\\n While field research often begins in a specific setting, the study’s purpose is to observe specific behaviors in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing how people think and behave. It seeks to understand why they behave that way. However, researchers may struggle to narrow down cause and effect when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment. And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables. Indeed, much of the data gathered in sociology do not identify a cause and effect but a correlation.\\n Figure 2.6 Researchers have used surveys and participant observations to accumulate data on Lady Gaga and Beyonce as multifaceted performers. (Credit a: John Robert Chartlon/flickr, b: Kristopher Harris/flickr.)\\n Sociologists have studied Lady Gaga and Beyoncé and their impact on music, movies, social media, fan participation, and social equality. In their studies, researchers have used several research methods including secondary analysis, participant observation, and surveys from concert participants.\\n In their study, Click, Lee & Holiday (2013) interviewed 45 Lady Gaga fans who utilized social media to communicate with the artist. These fans viewed Lady Gaga as a mirror of themselves and a source of inspiration. Like her, they embrace not being a part of mainstream culture. Many of Lady Gaga’s fans are members of the LGBTQ community. They see the “song “Born This Way” as a rallying cry and answer her calls for “Paws Up” with a physical expression of solidarity—outstretched arms and ﬁngers bent and curled to resemble monster claws.”\\n Sascha Buchanan (2019) made use of participant observation to study the relationship between two fan groups, that of Beyoncé and that of Rihanna. She observed award shows sponsored by iHeartRadio, MTV EMA, and BET that pit one group against another as they competed for Best Fan Army, Biggest Fans, and FANdemonium. Buchanan argues that the media thus sustains a myth of rivalry between the two most commercially successful Black women vocal artists.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\nThis section outlines the learning objectives for understanding the scientific method and research methods in sociology. It highlights how sociologists study social patterns and apply various research methods depending on the topic. These methods do not always allow for complete anonymity and must be selected based on the research's goals and context.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you should be able to:\\n•\\tDifferentiate values, beliefs, and norms\\n•\\tExplain the significance of symbols and language to a culture\\n•\\tExplain the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis\\n•\\tDiscuss the role of social control within culture\\nValues and Beliefs\\nThe first, and perhaps most crucial, elements of culture we will discuss are values and beliefs. Value does not mean monetary worth in sociology, but rather ideals, or principles and standards members of a culture hold in high regard. Most cultures in any society hold “knowledge” (education) in high regard. Values are deeply embedded and are critical for learning a culture’s beliefs, which are the tenets or convictions that people hold to be true. Individual cultures in a society have personal beliefs, but they also shared collective values. To illustrate the difference, U.S. citizens may believe in the American Dream—that anyone who works hard enough will be successful and wealthy. Underlying this belief is the American value that wealth is important. In other cultures, success may be tied less to wealth and more to having many healthy children. Values shape a society by suggesting what is good and bad, beautiful and ugly, sought or avoided.\\n Consider the value that the U.S. places upon youth. Children represent innocence and purity, while a youthful adult appearance signifies sexuality. Shaped by this value, individuals spend millions of dollars each year on cosmetic products and surgeries to look young and beautiful. The U.S. also has an individualistic culture, meaning people place a high value on individuality and independence. In contrast, many other cultures are collectivist, meaning the welfare of the group takes priority over that of the individual. Fulfilling a society’s values can be difficult. Marital monogamy is valued, but many spouses engage in infidelity. Cultural diversity and equal opportunities for all people are valued in the U.S., yet the country’s highest political offices have been dominated by white men.\\n Values often suggest how people should behave, but they don’t accurately reflect how people do behave. Values portray an ideal culture, the standards society would like to embrace and live up to. But ideal culture differs from real culture. In an ideal culture, there would be no traffic accidents, murders, poverty, or racial tension. But in real culture, police officers, lawmakers, educators, and social workers constantly strive to prevent or address these issues. American teenagers are encouraged to value celibacy. However, the number of unplanned pregnancies among teens reveals that the ideal alone is not enough to spare teenagers the potential consequences of having sex.\\n One of the ways societies strive to maintain its values is through rewards and punishments. When people observe the norms of society and uphold its values, they are often rewarded. A boy who helps an elderly woman board a bus may receive a smile and a “thank you.” A business manager who raises profit margins may receive a quarterly bonus. People sanction unwanted or inappropriate behaviors by withholding support, approval, or permission, or by implementing sanctions. We may think of ‘sanction’ as a negative term, but sanctions are forms of social control, ways to encourage conformity to cultural norms or rules.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Sometimes people conform to norms in anticipation or expectation of positive sanctions. Receiving good grades, for instance, may mean praise from parents and teachers. Sanctions can also be negative. A boy who shoves an elderly woman aside to board the bus first may receive frowns or even a scolding from other passengers. A business manager who drives away customers will likely be fired. Breaking norms and rejecting values can lead to cultural sanctions such as earning a negative label like ‘lazy’ or to legal sanctions, such as traffic tickets, fines, or imprisonment. Utilizing social control encourages most people to conform regardless of whether authority figures (such as law enforcement) are present.\\n Values are not static. They change across time and between groups as people evaluate, debate, and change collective social beliefs. Values also vary from culture to culture. For example, cultures differ in their values about what kinds of physical closeness are appropriate in public. It’s rare to see two male friends or coworkers holding hands in the U.S. where that behavior often symbolizes romantic feelings. But in many nations, masculine physical intimacy is considered natural in public. This difference in cultural values came to light when people reacted to photos of former president G.W. Bush holding hands with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in 2005. Simple gestures, such as hand-holding, carry great symbolic differences across cultures.\\n \\n Figure 3.5 In many parts of Africa and the Middle East, it is considered normal for men to hold hands in friendship. How would US citizens react to these two soldiers? (Credit: Geordie Mott/Wikimedia Commons)\\nNorms\\nSo far, many of the examples in this chapter have described how people are expected to behave in certain situations—for example, buying food or boarding a bus. These examples describe the visible and invisible rules of conduct through which societies are structured, or what sociologists call norms. Norms are behaviors that reflect compliance with what cultures and societies have defined as good, right, and important. Most members adhere to them.\\n Formal norms are established, written rules existing in all societies. They support many social institutions, such as the military, criminal justice and healthcare systems, and public schools. Functionalists may question what purpose these norms serve, conflict theorists might be interested in who creates, benefits, and suffers under these formal norms, and symbolic interactionists wonder about how a group that benefits interacts. Laws are formal norms, but so are employee manuals, college entrance exam requirements, and “no running” signs at swimming pools. Formal norms are the most specific and clearly stated of the various types of norms, and they are the most strictly enforced. But they are enforced to varying degrees.\\n For example, private property is highly valued in the U.S. Thieves can be fined, imprisoned, or both. People safeguard valuable possessions by locking their doors, buying a safe, and installing alarm systems on homes and cars. A less strictly enforced social norm is driving while intoxicated. While it’s against the law to drive drunk, drinking is for the most part an acceptable social behavior. And though there are laws to punish drunk driving, there are few systems in place to prevent the crime.\\n</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>There are plenty of formal norms, but the list of informal norms—casual behaviors that are generally and widely conformed to—is longer. People learn informal norms by observation, imitation, and general socialization. Some informal norms are taught directly— “Kiss your Aunt Edna” or “Use your napkin”—while others are learned by observation, including understanding consequences when someone else violates a norm. Informal norms dictate appropriate behaviors without the need of written rules and so may be difficult to learn when you are new to or not familiar with the culture.\\n Although informal norms define personal interactions, they extend into other systems as well. In the U.S., there are informal norms regarding behavior at fast food restaurants. Customers line up to order their food and leave when they are done. They don’t sit down at a table with strangers, sing loudly as they prepare their condiments, or nap in a booth. Most people don’t commit even harmless breaches of informal norms.\\n SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH\\nBreaching Experiments\\nSociologist Harold Garfinkel (1917–2011) studied people’s customs in order to find out how societal rules and norms not only influence behavior but also shape social order. He believed that members of society together create a social order (Weber, 2011). His resulting book, Studies in Ethno-methodology (1967) discusses people’s assumptions about the social makeup of their communities.\\n One of Garfinkel’s research methods was known as a “breaching experiment,” in which the researcher behaves in a socially awkward manner in order to test the sociological concepts of social norms and conformity. The participants are not aware an experiment is in progress, but their response is recorded. For example, if the experimenter is, say, a man in a business suit, and he skips down the sidewalk or hops on one foot, a passersby is likely to stare at him with surprised expressions. But the experimenter does not simply “act weird” in public. Rather, the point is to deviate from a specific social norm in a small way, to subtly break some form of social etiquette, and see what happens.\\n For example, he set up a simple game of tic-tac-toe. One player was asked beforehand to mark Xs and Os not in the boxes but on the lines dividing the spaces instead. The other player, in the dark about the study, was flabbergasted and did not know how to continue. The second player’s outrage, anger, puzzlement, or other emotion suggested that a cultural norms had been violated.\\n There are many rules about speaking with strangers in public. It is okay to tell a woman you like her shoes. It is not okay to ask if you can try them on. It is okay to stand in line behind someone at the ATM. It is not okay to look over his shoulder as he makes a transaction. It is okay to sit beside someone on a crowded bus. It’s weird to sit beside a stranger in a half-empty bus.\\n For some breaches, the researcher directly engages with innocent bystanders. An experimenter might strike up a conversation in a public bathroom, where it’s common to respect each other’s privacy.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>In a grocery store, an experimenter might take a food item out of another person’s grocery cart, saying, “That looks good! I think I’ll try it.” An experimenter might sit down at a table with others in a fast-food restaurant or follow someone around a museum and study the same paintings. In those cases, the bystanders are pressured to respond, and their discomfort illustrates how much we depend on social norms. Breaching experiments uncover and explore the many unwritten social rules we live by.\\n Norms may be further classified as either mores or folkways. Mores (mor-ays) are norms that embody the moral views and principles of a group. They often have a religious foundation. Violating them can have serious consequences. The strongest mores are protected with laws and other formal sanctions. In most societies, for instance, homicide is considered immoral, and it’s punishable by law (a formal norm). But more often, mores are judged and guarded by public sentiment (an informal norm). People who violate mores are seen as shameful. They can even be shunned or banned from some groups.\\n The mores of the U.S. school system require that a student’s writing be in the student’s own words or use special forms (such as quotation marks and a whole system of citation) for crediting other writers. Submitting or publishing another person’s words as if they are one’s own has a name—plagiarism. The consequences for violating this norm are often severe and can result in expulsion from school or termination from employment.\\n Unlike mores, folkways are norms without any moral underpinnings. Rather, folkways direct appropriate behavior in the day-to-day practices and expressions of a culture. We can think of them as ‘traditions’—things we do because we ‘always have.’ They indicate whether to shake hands or kiss on the cheek when greeting another person. They specify whether to wear a tie and blazer or a T-shirt and sandals to an event. In Canada, women can smile and say hello to men on the street. In Egypt, that’s not acceptable. In regions in the southern U.S., bumping into an acquaintance means stopping to chat. It’s considered rude not to, no matter how busy one is. In other regions, people guard their privacy and value time efficiency. A simple nod of the head is enough. Other accepted folkways in the U.S. may include holding the door open for a stranger or giving someone a gift on their birthday. The rules regarding these folkways may change from culture to culture. A folkway in one culture could be extremely rude in another.\\n Folkways are actions that people everywhere take for granted. People need to act without thinking in order to get seamlessly through daily routines. They can’t stop and analyze every action (Sumner, 1906). Folkways might be small actions, learned by observation and imitated, but they are by no means trivial. An important folkway in many cultures is kissing Grandmother on the cheek. Fail to do so and you will likely be scolded.\\n Symbols and Culture\\nHumans, consciously and subconsciously, are always striving to make sense of their surrounding world.</chunk4>\\n\\n<chunk5>Symbols—such as gestures, signs, objects, signals, and words—help people understand that world. They provide communication methods to understanding experiences by conveying recognizable meanings that are shared by societies.\\n The world is filled with symbols. Sports uniforms, company logos, and traffic signs are symbols. In some cultures, a gold ring is a symbol of marriage. Some symbols are highly functional; stop signs, for instance, provide useful instruction. As physical objects, they belong to material culture, but because they function as symbols, they also convey nonmaterial cultural meanings. Some symbols are valuable only in what they represent. Trophies, blue ribbons, or gold medals, for example, represent accomplishments. But many objects have both material and nonmaterial symbolic value.\\n \\n Figure 3.6 Some road signs are universal. But how would you interpret the signage on the right? (Credit: (a) Andrew Bain/flickr; (b) HonzaSoukup/flickr)\\nSymbols often get noticed when they are out of context. Used unconventionally, they convey strong messages. A stop sign placed on the door of a college building makes a political statement, as does a camouflage military jacket worn in an antiwar protest. Together, the semaphore signals for “N” and “D” represent nuclear disarmament—and form the well-known peace sign (Westcott, 2008). Some college students wear pajamas and bedroom slippers to class, clothing that was formerly associated only with privacy and bedtime. By wearing the outfit, students are defying traditional cultural norms.\\n Some symbols represent only one side of the story and elicit strong emotions, which can lead to social unrest. Their presence is a reminder of a nation’s worst times and not something to celebrate. Many of these symbols are targets of vandalism as the destruction of these representations is symbolic. Effigies representing public figures are burned to demonstrate anger at certain leaders. In 1989, crowds tore down the Berlin Wall, a decades-old symbol of the division between East and West Germany, communism, and capitalism. In the U.S. beginning in 2019, statues associated with slavery and the Civil War were removed from state capitols, college campuses, and public parks. In Germany, any display of Hitler or Nazi memorabilia or to deny the Holocaust is illegal.\\n While different cultures have varying systems of symbols, one system is common to all: language. Whatever its form, people learn social and cultural norms through it.\\n Language and Symbols\\nLanguage is a system that uses symbols with which people communicate and through which culture is transmitted. Letters (which make up words), pictographs, and hand gestures are all symbols that create a language used for communication. Sign language, for example, requires an intimate knowledge not only of an alphabet but also of signs that represent entire words and the meaning indicated by certain facial expressions or postures. Its grammar differs from the spoken language. As spoken language is different across regions, nations and cultures, and can even differ by the age of the person, so too does sign language.\\n All language systems contain the same basic elements that are effective in communicating ideas - object, subject, action.</chunk5>\\n\\n<chunk6>A written language system consists of symbols that refer to spoken sound. Taken together, these symbols convey specific meanings. The English language uses a combination of twenty-six letters to create words. These twenty-six letters make up over 600,000 recognized words (OED Online, 2011). We can compare the reliance on tone and inflection to Mandarin Chinese. It contains over 8,000 characters, but the same character may symbolize different concepts depending on the tone used.\\n English today contains an English and French version for the same concept. For example, in the English version, one eats, but in French version, one dines. In the English version, we meet someone. In the French version, we encounter someone. Readers of American English may be surprised by the inclusion of a ‘u’ in some spellings of words like ‘behaviour’ or ‘flavour.’ Americans have dropped that ‘u’ that writers of British English include. Billions of people speak English, and there are almost as many pronunciations of it.\\n Rules for speaking and writing vary even within cultures, most notably by region. Do you eat a grinder, a sub, or a hero/gyro? Do you refer to a can of carbonated liquid as “soda” or “pop”? Is a household entertainment room a “family room,” “rec room,” or “den”? When leaving a restaurant, do you ask your server for a “check,” the “ticket,” or your “bill”? Language is constantly evolving and adding new words as societies create new ideas. In this age of technology, many cultures have adapted almost instantly to new nouns such as “e-mail” and “Internet,” and verbs such as “downloading,” “texting,” and “blogging.” These would have been considered nonsense words in the world just twenty-five years ago.\\n Language and Culture\\nEven while it constantly evolves, language shapes our perception of reality and our behavior. In the 1920s, linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf advanced this idea which became known as Sapir-Whorf hypothesis or linguistic relativity. It is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language, and therefore understand their world through the cultural meanings embedded in their language. The hypothesis suggests that language shapes thought and thus behavior (Swoyer, 2003). For example, words have attached meanings beyond their definition that can influence thought and behavior. In the U.S. where the number thirteen is associated with bad luck, many high-rise buildings do not have a 13th floor. In Japan, however, the number four is considered unlucky, since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for “death.”\\n Many sociologists believe that language can have a broad and lasting impact on perception. In 2002, Lera Boroditsky and her colleagues conducted experiments on native German and Spanish speakers in English. Unlike English, these languages assign genders to nouns. In German, for example, the word for sun, die Sonne, is feminine, but the word for moon, der Mond, is masculine.</chunk6>\\n\\n<chunk7>The team chose a set of nouns with opposite genders in German and Spanish and asked participants to provide adjectives to describe them. They found that German speakers used more masculine adjectives than Spanish speakers when describing a noun that was grammatically masculine in German but feminine in Spanish. For example, the word for key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. German speakers described keys as hard, heavy, jagged, metal, serrated, and useful, while Spanish speakers used the adjectives, golden, intricate, little, lovely, shiny, and tiny. The team concluded that gender perceptions acquired in a person’s native language carry forward to how they see the world even when they switch to a language without grammatical genders (Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips, 2002).\\n Some sociologists also believe the structure of language can have consequences on both individual and group behavior. For example, a series of studies have found that Finland has a significantly higher rate of workplace accidents than Sweden despite the fact that the languages have similar workplace regulations (Salminen & Johansson, 2000). John A. Lucy explained this discrepancy through differences in the structure of these languages. Swedish places a greater emphasis on the timing of movement in three-dimensional space. Consequently, Lucy argued, the Swedish factories are physically arranged in a manner that supports the smooth running of the product process. Finnish factors experience frequent disruptions, so that workers must rush and have more accidents (Lucy, 1997).\\n The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has been interpreted to suggest that if a word does not exist in a language then users of that language cannot have the experience. Studies have shown, for instance, that unless people have access to the word “ambivalent,” they don’t recognize having conflicting positive and negative feelings about an issue as ‘ambivalence.’ However, the hypothesis should not suggest that people do not have conflicting feelings but rather that they interpret the feelings differently.\\n In addition to using spoken language, people communicate without words. Nonverbal communication is symbolic, and, as in the case of language, is learned through one’s culture. Some gestures are nearly universal; some are not. Smiles often indicate positive reinforcement in the U.S., whereas in some cultures it is rude as you do not know the person. A thumbs-up in Russia and Australia is an offensive curse (Passero, 2002). Other gestures vary in meaning depending on the situation and the person. A wave of the hand can mean many things, depending on how it’s done and for whom. It may mean “hello,” “goodbye,” “no thank you,” or “I’m royalty.” Winks convey a variety of messages, including “We have a secret,” “I’m only kidding,” or “I’m attracted to you.” From a distance, a person may “read” the emotional situation of people just by watching their body language and facial expressions. However, many cultures communicate with lots of physicality, which people outside that culture may interpret as an argument. So, for example, you might believe two people are arguing when, in fact, they are simply having a regular conversation.\\n</chunk7>\\n\\n<chunk8>SOCIAL POLICY AND DEBATE\\nIs the U.S. Bilingual?\\n When she was six, Lucy and her family immigrated to the United States and attended a school that allowed for the use of both English and Spanish. Lucy’s teacher and many staff were bilingual (fluent in English and Spanish), and the district offered books in both languages. While she was being driven to learn English, the dual-language option helped to ensure that she did not become lost and get behind in her learning of all subjects. Having math, science, and computing taught in both languages helped her understand those concepts and skills. Within two years of enrolling in the school, Lucy was getting nearly all of her instruction in English, and rarely used the Spanish-language books or resources. While she still had trouble with some intricacies of English, her math progress was above grade level and she did well in other subjects as well.\\n Some people might believe that Lucy would have learned faster had she been instructed only in English. But research indicates that is not the case. Johns Hopkins University researchers conducted a series of studies on the effects of bilingual education across multiple subjects (Slavin et al. 2008). They found that students taught in both their native tongue and English make better progress than those taught only in English.\\n Legally, the U.S. has no official language. But many believe English to be the rightful language of the U.S., and over thirty states have passed laws specifying English as their official tongue. Proponents of English-only laws suggest that a national ruling will save money on translation, printing, and human resource costs, including funding for bilingual teachers. They argue that setting English as the official language will encourage non-English speakers to learn English faster and adapt to the culture of the U.S. more easily (Mount 2010). Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) oppose making English the official language and claim that it violates the rights of non-English speakers. English-only laws, they believe, deny the reality of our nation’s diversity and unfairly target non-English speakers. They point to the fact that much of the debate on this topic has risen since 1970, a period during which the U.S. has experienced new waves of immigration from Asia and Mexico.\\n Today, a lot of product information gets written in multiple languages. Enter a store like Home Depot and you’ll find signs in both English and Spanish. Buy a children’s product and the safety warnings could be presented in multiple languages. While marketers are financially motivated to reach the largest number of consumers possible, this trend also may help people become accustomed to a culture of bilingualism.\\n Studies show that most US immigrants eventually abandon their native tongues and become fluent in English. Bilingual education helps with that transition. Today, Lucy is an ambitious and high-achieving college student. Fluent in both English and Spanish, Lucy is studying law enforcement—a field that seeks bilingual employees. The same bilingualism that contributed to her success in grade school will help her thrive professionally as a law officer serving her community.\\n \\n Figure 3.7 Many signs—on streets and in stores—include both English and Spanish. What effect does this have on members of society? What effect does it have on our culture?

Taken together, these symbols convey specific meanings. The English language uses a combination of twenty-six letters to create words. These twenty-six letters make up over 600,000 recognized words (OED Online, 2011). We can compare the reliance on tone and inflection to Mandarin Chinese. It contains over 8,000 characters, but the same character may symbolize different concepts depending on the tone used.\\n English today contains an English and French version for the same concept. For example, in the English version, one eats, but in French version, one dines. In the English version, we meet someone. In the French version, we encounter someone. Readers of American English may be surprised by the inclusion of a ‘u’ in some spellings of words like ‘behaviour’ or ‘flavour.’ Americans have dropped that ‘u’ that writers of British English include. Billions of people speak English, and there are almost as many pronunciations of it.\\n Rules for speaking and writing vary even within cultures, most notably by region. Do you eat a grinder, a sub, or a hero/gyro? Do you refer to a can of carbonated liquid as “soda” or “pop”? Is a household entertainment room a “family room,” “rec room,” or “den”? When leaving a restaurant, do you ask your server for a “check,” the “ticket,” or your “bill”? Language is constantly evolving and adding new words as societies create new ideas. In this age of technology, many cultures have adapted almost instantly to new nouns such as “e-mail” and “Internet,” and verbs such as “downloading,” “texting,” and “blogging.” These would have been considered nonsense words in the world just twenty-five years ago.\\n Language and Culture\\nEven while it constantly evolves, language shapes our perception of reality and our behavior. In the 1920s, linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf advanced this idea which became known as Sapir-Whorf hypothesis or linguistic relativity. It is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language, and therefore understand their world through the cultural meanings embedded in their language. The hypothesis suggests that language shapes thought and thus behavior (Swoyer, 2003). For example, words have attached meanings beyond their definition that can influence thought and behavior. In the U.S. where the number thirteen is associated with bad luck, many high-rise buildings do not have a 13th floor. In Japan, however, the number four is considered unlucky, since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for “death.”\\n Many sociologists believe that language can have a broad and lasting impact on perception. In 2002, Lera Boroditsky and her colleagues conducted experiments on native German and Spanish speakers in English. Unlike English, these languages assign genders to nouns. In German, for example, the word for sun, die Sonne, is feminine, but the word for moon, der Mond, is masculine.\\nThe team chose a set of nouns with opposite genders in German and Spanish and asked participants to provide adjectives to describe them. They found that German speakers used more masculine adjectives than Spanish speakers when describing a noun that was grammatically masculine in German but feminine in Spanish. For example, the word for key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. German speakers described keys as hard, heavy, jagged, metal, serrated, and useful, while Spanish speakers used the adjectives, golden, intricate, little, lovely, shiny, and tiny. The team concluded that gender perceptions acquired in a person’s native language carry forward to how they see the world even when they switch to a language without grammatical genders (Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips, 2002).\\n Some sociologists also believe the structure of language can have consequences on both individual and group behavior. For example, a series of studies have found that Finland has a significantly higher rate of workplace accidents than Sweden despite the fact that the languages have similar workplace regulations (Salminen & Johansson, 2000). John A. Lucy explained this discrepancy through differences in the structure of these languages. Swedish places a greater emphasis on the timing of movement in three-dimensional space. Consequently, Lucy argued, the Swedish factories are physically arranged in a manner that supports the smooth running of the product process. Finnish factors experience frequent disruptions, so that workers must rush and have more accidents (Lucy, 1997).\\n The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has been interpreted to suggest that if a word does not exist in a language then users of that language cannot have the experience. Studies have shown, for instance, that unless people have access to the word “ambivalent,” they don’t recognize having conflicting positive and negative feelings about an issue as ‘ambivalence.’ However, the hypothesis should not suggest that people do not have conflicting feelings but rather that they interpret the feelings differently.\\n In addition to using spoken language, people communicate without words. Nonverbal communication is symbolic, and, as in the case of language, is learned through one’s culture. Some gestures are nearly universal; some are not. Smiles often indicate positive reinforcement in the U.S., whereas in some cultures it is rude as you do not know the person. A thumbs-up in Russia and Australia is an offensive curse (Passero, 2002). Other gestures vary in meaning depending on the situation and the person. A wave of the hand can mean many things, depending on how it’s done and for whom. It may mean “hello,” “goodbye,” “no thank you,” or “I’m royalty.” Winks convey a variety of messages, including “We have a secret,” “I’m only kidding,” or “I’m attracted to you.” From a distance, a person may “read” the emotional situation of people just by watching their body language and facial expressions. However, many cultures communicate with lots of physicality, which people outside that culture may interpret as an argument. So, for example, you might believe two people are arguing when, in fact, they are simply having a regular conversation.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nThe importance of values and beliefs in culture is highlighted, explaining their role in shaping societal norms and behaviors.

They provide communication methods to understanding experiences by conveying recognizable meanings that are shared by societies.\\n The world is filled with symbols. Sports uniforms, company logos, and traffic signs are symbols. In some cultures, a gold ring is a symbol of marriage. Some symbols are highly functional; stop signs, for instance, provide useful instruction. As physical objects, they belong to material culture, but because they function as symbols, they also convey nonmaterial cultural meanings. Some symbols are valuable only in what they represent. Trophies, blue ribbons, or gold medals, for example, represent accomplishments. But many objects have both material and nonmaterial symbolic value.\\n \\n Figure 3.6 Some road signs are universal. But how would you interpret the signage on the right? (Credit: (a) Andrew Bain/flickr; (b) HonzaSoukup/flickr)\\nSymbols often get noticed when they are out of context. Used unconventionally, they convey strong messages. A stop sign placed on the door of a college building makes a political statement, as does a camouflage military jacket worn in an antiwar protest. Together, the semaphore signals for “N” and “D” represent nuclear disarmament—and form the well-known peace sign (Westcott, 2008). Some college students wear pajamas and bedroom slippers to class, clothing that was formerly associated only with privacy and bedtime. By wearing the outfit, students are defying traditional cultural norms.\\n Some symbols represent only one side of the story and elicit strong emotions, which can lead to social unrest. Their presence is a reminder of a nation’s worst times and not something to celebrate. Many of these symbols are targets of vandalism as the destruction of these representations is symbolic. Effigies representing public figures are burned to demonstrate anger at certain leaders. In 1989, crowds tore down the Berlin Wall, a decades-old symbol of the division between East and West Germany, communism, and capitalism. In the U.S. beginning in 2019, statues associated with slavery and the Civil War were removed from state capitols, college campuses, and public parks. In Germany, any display of Hitler or Nazi memorabilia or to deny the Holocaust is illegal.\\n While different cultures have varying systems of symbols, one system is common to all: language. Whatever its form, people learn social and cultural norms through it.\\n Language and Symbols\\nLanguage is a system that uses symbols with which people communicate and through which culture is transmitted. Letters (which make up words), pictographs, and hand gestures are all symbols that create a language used for communication. Sign language, for example, requires an intimate knowledge not only of an alphabet but also of signs that represent entire words and the meaning indicated by certain facial expressions or postures. Its grammar differs from the spoken language. As spoken language is different across regions, nations and cultures, and can even differ by the age of the person, so too does sign language.\\n All language systems contain the same basic elements that are effective in communicating ideas - object, subject, action.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\nThe importance of values and beliefs in culture is highlighted, explaining their role in shaping societal norms and behaviors.

Taken together, these symbols convey specific meanings. The English language uses a combination of twenty-six letters to create words. These twenty-six letters make up over 600,000 recognized words (OED Online, 2011). We can compare the reliance on tone and inflection to Mandarin Chinese. It contains over 8,000 characters, but the same character may symbolize different concepts depending on the tone used.\\n English today contains an English and French version for the same concept. For example, in the English version, one eats, but in French version, one dines. In the English version, we meet someone. In the French version, we encounter someone. Readers of American English may be surprised by the inclusion of a ‘u’ in some spellings of words like ‘behaviour’ or ‘flavour.’ Americans have dropped that ‘u’ that writers of British English include. Billions of people speak English, and there are almost as many pronunciations of it.\\n Rules for speaking and writing vary even within cultures, most notably by region. Do you eat a grinder, a sub, or a hero/gyro? Do you refer to a can of carbonated liquid as “soda” or “pop”? Is a household entertainment room a “family room,” “rec room,” or “den”? When leaving a restaurant, do you ask your server for a “check,” the “ticket,” or your “bill”? Language is constantly evolving and adding new words as societies create new ideas. In this age of technology, many cultures have adapted almost instantly to new nouns such as “e-mail” and “Internet,” and verbs such as “downloading,” “texting,” and “blogging.” These would have been considered nonsense words in the world just twenty-five years ago.\\n Language and Culture\\nEven while it constantly evolves, language shapes our perception of reality and our behavior. In the 1920s, linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf advanced this idea which became known as Sapir-Whorf hypothesis or linguistic relativity. It is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language, and therefore understand their world through the cultural meanings embedded in their language. The hypothesis suggests that language shapes thought and thus behavior (Swoyer, 2003). For example, words have attached meanings beyond their definition that can influence thought and behavior. In the U.S. where the number thirteen is associated with bad luck, many high-rise buildings do not have a 13th floor. In Japan, however, the number four is considered unlucky, since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for “death.”\\n Many sociologists believe that language can have a broad and lasting impact on perception. In 2002, Lera Boroditsky and her colleagues conducted experiments on native German and Spanish speakers in English. Unlike English, these languages assign genders to nouns. In German, for example, the word for sun, die Sonne, is feminine, but the word for moon, der Mond, is masculine.\\nThe team chose a set of nouns with opposite genders in German and Spanish and asked participants to provide adjectives to describe them. They found that German speakers used more masculine adjectives than Spanish speakers when describing a noun that was grammatically masculine in German but feminine in Spanish. For example, the word for key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. German speakers described keys as hard, heavy, jagged, metal, serrated, and useful, while Spanish speakers used the adjectives, golden, intricate, little, lovely, shiny, and tiny. The team concluded that gender perceptions acquired in a person’s native language carry forward to how they see the world even when they switch to a language without grammatical genders (Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips, 2002).\\n Some sociologists also believe the structure of language can have consequences on both individual and group behavior. For example, a series of studies have found that Finland has a significantly higher rate of workplace accidents than Sweden despite the fact that the languages have similar workplace regulations (Salminen & Johansson, 2000). John A. Lucy explained this discrepancy through differences in the structure of these languages. Swedish places a greater emphasis on the timing of movement in three-dimensional space. Consequently, Lucy argued, the Swedish factories are physically arranged in a manner that supports the smooth running of the product process. Finnish factors experience frequent disruptions, so that workers must rush and have more accidents (Lucy, 1997).\\n The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has been interpreted to suggest that if a word does not exist in a language then users of that language cannot have the experience. Studies have shown, for instance, that unless people have access to the word “ambivalent,” they don’t recognize having conflicting positive and negative feelings about an issue as ‘ambivalence.’ However, the hypothesis should not suggest that people do not have conflicting feelings but rather that they interpret the feelings differently.\\n In addition to using spoken language, people communicate without words. Nonverbal communication is symbolic, and, as in the case of language, is learned through one’s culture. Some gestures are nearly universal; some are not. Smiles often indicate positive reinforcement in the U.S., whereas in some cultures it is rude as you do not know the person. A thumbs-up in Russia and Australia is an offensive curse (Passero, 2002). Other gestures vary in meaning depending on the situation and the person. A wave of the hand can mean many things, depending on how it’s done and for whom. It may mean “hello,” “goodbye,” “no thank you,” or “I’m royalty.” Winks convey a variety of messages, including “We have a secret,” “I’m only kidding,” or “I’m attracted to you.” From a distance, a person may “read” the emotional situation of people just by watching their body language and facial expressions. However, many cultures communicate with lots of physicality, which people outside that culture may interpret as an argument. So, for example, you might believe two people are arguing when, in fact, they are simply having a regular conversation.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\nThe importance of values and beliefs in culture is highlighted, explaining their role in shaping societal norms and behaviors.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you should be able to:\\n•\\tRecall the 6 Steps of the Scientific Method\\n•\\tDifferentiate between four kinds of research methods: surveys, field research, experiments, and secondary data analysis.\\n •\\tExplain the appropriateness of specific research approaches for specific topics.\\n Sociologists examine the social world, see a problem or interesting pattern, and set out to study it. They use research methods to design a study. Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study. Sociologists generally choose from widely used methods of social investigation: primary source data collection such as survey, participant observation, ethnography, case study, unobtrusive observations, experiment, and secondary data analysis, or use of existing sources. Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use. When you are conducting research think about the best way to gather or obtain knowledge about your topic, think of yourself as an architect. An architect needs a blueprint to build a house, as a sociologist your blueprint is your research design including your data collection method.\\n When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being observed. A researcher wouldn’t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, “Any gang members around?”\\n Making sociologists’ presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers can’t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe behaviors or attract attention. In situations like these, other methods are needed. Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics, protect research participants or subjects, and that fit with their overall approaches to research.\\n Surveys\\nAs a research method, a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire or an interview. The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in which they can express personal ideas.\\n Figure 2.3 Questionnaires are a common research method. (Credit: CDC Global/flickr)\\n At some point, most people in the United States respond to some type of survey. The 2020 U.S. Census is an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Since 1790, United States has conducted a survey consisting of six questions to received demographical data pertaining to residents. The questions pertain to the demographics of the residents who live in the United States. Currently, the Census is received by residents in the United Stated and five territories and consists of 12 questions.\\n Not all surveys are considered sociological research, however, and many surveys people commonly encounter focus on identifying marketing needs and strategies rather than testing a hypothesis or contributing to social science knowledge.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Questions such as, “How many hot dogs do you eat in a month?” or “Were the staff helpful?” are not usually designed as scientific research. The Nielsen Ratings determine the popularity of television programming through scientific market research. However, polls conducted by television programs such as American Idol or So You Think You Can Dance cannot be generalized, because they are administered to an unrepresentative population, a specific show’s audience. You might receive polls through your cell phones or emails, from grocery stores, restaurants, and retail stores. They often provide you incentives for completing the survey.\\n Figure 2.4 Real-time surveys are common in classrooms, live-audience events, and even popular media. Twitter polls have often replaced physical devices such as the one pictured. (Credit: Sam Howzit/flickr)\\nSociologists conduct surveys under controlled conditions for specific purposes. Surveys gather different types of information from people. While surveys are not great at capturing the ways people really behave in social situations, they are a great method for discovering how people feel, think, and act—or at least how they say they feel, think, and act. Surveys can track preferences for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors (such as sleeping, driving, or texting habits) or information such as employment status, income, and education levels.\\n A survey targets a specific population, people who are the focus of a study, such as college athletes, international students, or teenagers living with type 1 (juvenile-onset) diabetes. Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population, or a sample, a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population. The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample. In a random sample, every person in a population has the same chance of being chosen for the study. As a result, a Gallup Poll, if conducted as a nationwide random sampling, should be able to provide an accurate estimate of public opinion whether it contacts 2,000 or 10,000 people.\\n After selecting subjects, the researcher develops a specific plan to ask questions and record responses. It is important to inform subjects of the nature and purpose of the survey up front. If they agree to participate, researchers thank subjects and offer them a chance to see the results of the study if they are interested. The researcher presents the subjects with an instrument, which is a means of gathering the information.\\n A common instrument is a questionnaire. Subjects often answer a series of closed-ended questions. The researcher might ask yes-or-no or multiple-choice questions, allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question. This kind of questionnaire collects quantitative data—data in numerical form that can be counted and statistically analyzed. Just count up the number of “yes” and “no” responses or correct answers, and chart them into percentages.\\n Questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers—beyond “yes,” “no,” or checkbox options. These types of inquiries use open-ended questions that require short essay responses.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Participants willing to take the time to write those answers might convey personal religious beliefs, political views, goals, or morals. The answers are subjective and vary from person to person. How do you plan to use your college education?\\n Some topics that investigate internal thought processes are impossible to observe directly and are difficult to discuss honestly in a public forum. People are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously. This type of personal explanation is qualitative data—conveyed through words. Qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate. The researcher will end up with a wide range of responses, some of which may be surprising. The benefit of written opinions, though, is the wealth of in-depth material that they provide.\\n An interview is a one-on-one conversation between the researcher and the subject, and it is a way of conducting surveys on a topic. However, participants are free to respond as they wish, without being limited by predetermined choices. In the back-and-forth conversation of an interview, a researcher can ask for clarification, spend more time on a subtopic, or ask additional questions. In an interview, a subject will ideally feel free to open up and answer questions that are often complex. There are no right or wrong answers. The subject might not even know how to answer the questions honestly.\\n Questions such as “How does society’s view of alcohol consumption influence your decision whether or not to take your first sip of alcohol?” or “Did you feel that the divorce of your parents would put a social stigma on your family?” involve so many factors that the answers are difficult to categorize. A researcher needs to avoid steering or prompting the subject to respond in a specific way; otherwise, the results will prove to be unreliable. The researcher will also benefit from gaining a subject’s trust, from empathizing or commiserating with a subject, and from listening without judgment.\\n Surveys often collect both quantitative and qualitative data. For example, a researcher interviewing people who are incarcerated might receive quantitative data, such as demographics – race, age, sex, that can be analyzed statistically. For example, the researcher might discover that 20 percent of incarcerated people are above the age of 50. The researcher might also collect qualitative data, such as why people take advantage of educational opportunities during their sentence and other explanatory information.\\n The survey can be carried out online, over the phone, by mail, or face-to-face. When researchers collect data outside a laboratory, library, or workplace setting, they are conducting field research, which is our next topic.\\n Field Research\\nThe work of sociology rarely happens in limited, confined spaces. Rather, sociologists go out into the world. They meet subjects where they live, work, and play. Field research refers to gathering primary data from a natural environment. To conduct field research, the sociologist must be willing to step into new environments and observe, participate, or experience those worlds. In field work, the sociologists, rather than the subjects, are the ones out of their element.\\n</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>The researcher interacts with or observes people and gathers data along the way. The key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject’s natural environment, whether it’s a coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.\\n Figure 2.5 Sociological researchers travel across countries and cultures to interact with and observe subjects in their natural environments. (Credit: IMLS Digital Collections and Content/flickr)\\n While field research often begins in a specific setting, the study’s purpose is to observe specific behaviors in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing how people think and behave. It seeks to understand why they behave that way. However, researchers may struggle to narrow down cause and effect when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment. And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables. Indeed, much of the data gathered in sociology do not identify a cause and effect but a correlation.\\n Figure 2.6 Researchers have used surveys and participant observations to accumulate data on Lady Gaga and Beyonce as multifaceted performers. (Credit a: John Robert Chartlon/flickr, b: Kristopher Harris/flickr.)\\n Sociologists have studied Lady Gaga and Beyoncé and their impact on music, movies, social media, fan participation, and social equality. In their studies, researchers have used several research methods including secondary analysis, participant observation, and surveys from concert participants.\\n In their study, Click, Lee & Holiday (2013) interviewed 45 Lady Gaga fans who utilized social media to communicate with the artist. These fans viewed Lady Gaga as a mirror of themselves and a source of inspiration. Like her, they embrace not being a part of mainstream culture. Many of Lady Gaga’s fans are members of the LGBTQ community. They see the “song “Born This Way” as a rallying cry and answer her calls for “Paws Up” with a physical expression of solidarity—outstretched arms and ﬁngers bent and curled to resemble monster claws.”\\n Sascha Buchanan (2019) made use of participant observation to study the relationship between two fan groups, that of Beyoncé and that of Rihanna. She observed award shows sponsored by iHeartRadio, MTV EMA, and BET that pit one group against another as they competed for Best Fan Army, Biggest Fans, and FANdemonium. Buchanan argues that the media thus sustains a myth of rivalry between the two most commercially successful Black women vocal artists.</chunk4>\\n\\n<chunk5>\\nParticipant Observation\\nIn 2000, a comic writer named Rodney Rothman wanted an insider’s view of white-collar work. He slipped into the sterile, high-rise offices of a New York “dot com” agency. Every day for two weeks, he pretended to work there. His main purpose was simply to see whether anyone would notice him or challenge his presence. No one did. The receptionist greeted him. The employees smiled and said good morning. Rothman was accepted as part of the team. He even went so far as to claim a desk, inform the receptionist of his whereabouts, and attend a meeting. He published an article about his experience in The New Yorker called “My Fake Job” (2000). Later, he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology. However, Rothman’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “dot com” company and exemplified the lengths to which a writer, or a sociologist, will go to uncover material.\\n Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation, in which researchers join people and participate in a group’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context. This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life. A researcher might go to great lengths to get a firsthand look into a trend, institution, or behavior. A researcher might work as a waitress in a diner, experience homelessness for several weeks, or ride along with police officers as they patrol their regular beat. Often, these researchers try to blend in seamlessly with the population they study, and they may not disclose their true identity or purpose if they feel it would compromise the results of their research.\\n Figure 2.7 Is she a working waitress or a sociologist conducting a study using participant observation? A field researcher may take a job or take other steps to get firsthand knowledge of their subjects. (Credit: Gareth Williams/flickr.)\\n At the beginning of a field study, researchers might have a question: “What really goes on in the kitchen of the most popular diner on campus?” or “What is it like to be homeless?” Participant observation is a useful method if the researcher wants to explore a certain environment from the inside.\\n Field researchers simply want to observe and learn. In such a setting, the researcher will be alert and open minded to whatever happens, recording all observations accurately. Soon, as patterns emerge, questions will become more specific, observations will lead to hypotheses, and hypotheses will guide the researcher in analyzing data and generating results.\\n In a study of small towns in the United States conducted by sociological researchers John S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd, the team altered their purpose as they gathered data. They initially planned to focus their study on the role of religion in U.S. towns. As they gathered observations, they realized that the effect of industrialization and urbanization was the more relevant topic of this social group. The Lynds did not change their methods, but they revised the purpose of their study.\\n</chunk5>\\n\\n<chunk6>This shaped the structure of Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture, their published results (Lynd & Lynd, 1929).\\n The Lynds were upfront about their mission. The townspeople of Muncie, Indiana, knew why the researchers were in their midst. But some sociologists prefer not to alert people to their presence. The main advantage of covert participant observation is that it allows the researcher access to authentic, natural behaviors of a group’s members. The challenge, however, is gaining access to a setting without disrupting the pattern of others’ behavior. Becoming an inside member of a group, organization, or subculture takes time and effort. Researchers must pretend to be something they are not. The process could involve role playing, making contacts, networking, or applying for a job.\\n Once inside a group, some researchers spend months or even years pretending to be one of the people they are observing. However, as observers, they cannot get too involved. They must keep their purpose in mind and apply the sociological perspective. That way, they illuminate social patterns that are often unrecognized. Because information gathered during participant observation is mostly qualitative, rather than quantitative, the end results are often descriptive or interpretive. The researcher might present findings in an article or book and describe what he or she witnessed and experienced.\\n This type of research is what journalist Barbara Ehrenreich conducted for her book Nickel and Dimed. One day over lunch with her editor, Ehrenreich mentioned an idea. How can people exist on minimum-wage work? How do low-income workers get by? she wondered. Someone should do a study. To her surprise, her editor responded, Why don’t you do it?\\n That’s how Ehrenreich found herself joining the ranks of the working class. For several months, she left her comfortable home and lived and worked among people who lacked, for the most part, higher education and marketable job skills. Undercover, she applied for and worked minimum wage jobs as a waitress, a cleaning woman, a nursing home aide, and a retail chain employee. During her participant observation, she used only her income from those jobs to pay for food, clothing, transportation, and shelter.\\n She discovered the obvious, that it’s almost impossible to get by on minimum wage work. She also experienced and observed attitudes many middle and upper-class people never think about. She witnessed firsthand the treatment of working class employees. She saw the extreme measures people take to make ends meet and to survive. She described fellow employees who held two or three jobs, worked seven days a week, lived in cars, could not pay to treat chronic health conditions, got randomly fired, submitted to drug tests, and moved in and out of homeless shelters. She brought aspects of that life to light, describing difficult working conditions and the poor treatment that low-wage workers suffer.\\n The book she wrote upon her return to her real life as a well-paid writer, has been widely read and used in many college classrooms.\\n Figure 2.8 Field research happens in real locations.</chunk6>\\n\\n<chunk7>What type of environment do work spaces foster? What would a sociologist discover after blending in? (Credit: Lyncconf Games/flickr)\\n Ethnography\\nEthnography is the immersion of the researcher in the natural setting of an entire social community to observe and experience their everyday life and culture. The heart of an ethnographic study focuses on how subjects view their own social standing and how they understand themselves in relation to a social group.\\n An ethnographic study might observe, for example, a small U.S. fishing town, an Inuit community, a village in Thailand, a Buddhist monastery, a private boarding school, or an amusement park. These places all have borders. People live, work, study, or vacation within those borders. People are there for a certain reason and therefore behave in certain ways and respect certain cultural norms. An ethnographer would commit to spending a determined amount of time studying every aspect of the chosen place, taking in as much as possible.\\n A sociologist studying a tribe in the Amazon might watch the way villagers go about their daily lives and then write a paper about it. To observe a spiritual retreat center, an ethnographer might sign up for a retreat and attend as a guest for an extended stay, observe and record data, and collate the material into results.\\n Institutional Ethnography\\nInstitutional ethnography is an extension of basic ethnographic research principles that focuses intentionally on everyday concrete social relationships. Developed by Canadian sociologist Dorothy E. Smith (1990), institutional ethnography is often considered a feminist-inspired approach to social analysis and primarily considers women’s experiences within male- dominated societies and power structures. Smith’s work is seen to challenge sociology’s exclusion of women, both academically and in the study of women’s lives (Fenstermaker, n.d.).\\n Historically, social science research tended to objectify women and ignore their experiences except as viewed from the male perspective. Modern feminists note that describing women, and other marginalized groups, as subordinates helps those in authority maintain their own dominant positions (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada n.d.). Smith’s three major works explored what she called “the conceptual practices of power” and are still considered seminal works in feminist theory and ethnography (Fensternmaker n.d.).\\n SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH\\nThe Making of Middletown: A Study in Modern U.S. Culture\\nIn 1924, a young married couple named Robert and Helen Lynd undertook an unprecedented ethnography: to apply sociological methods to the study of one U.S. city in order to discover what “ordinary” people in the United States did and believed. Choosing Muncie, Indiana (population about 30,000) as their subject, they moved to the small town and lived there for eighteen months.\\n Ethnographers had been examining other cultures for decades—groups considered minorities or outsiders—like gangs, immigrants, and the poor. But no one had studied the so-called average American.\\n Recording interviews and using surveys to gather data, the Lynds objectively described what they observed. Researching existing sources, they compared Muncie in 1890 to the Muncie they observed in 1924. Most Muncie adults, they found, had grown up on farms but now lived in homes inside the city.</chunk7>\\n\\n<chunk8>As a result, the Lynds focused their study on the impact of industrialization and urbanization.\\n They observed that Muncie was divided into business and working class groups. They defined business class as dealing with abstract concepts and symbols, while working class people used tools to create concrete objects. The two classes led different lives with different goals and hopes. However, the Lynds observed, mass production offered both classes the same amenities. Like wealthy families, the working class was now able to own radios, cars, washing machines, telephones, vacuum cleaners, and refrigerators. This was an emerging material reality of the 1920s.\\n As the Lynds worked, they divided their manuscript into six chapters: Getting a Living, Making a Home, Training the Young, Using Leisure, Engaging in Religious Practices, and Engaging in Community Activities.\\n When the study was completed, the Lynds encountered a big problem. The Rockefeller Foundation, which had commissioned the book, claimed it was useless and refused to publish it. The Lynds asked if they could seek a publisher themselves.\\n Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture was not only published in 1929 but also became an instant bestseller, a status unheard of for a sociological study. The book sold out six printings in its first year of publication, and has never gone out of print (Caplow, Hicks, & Wattenberg. 2000).\\n Nothing like it had ever been done before. Middletown was reviewed on the front page of the New York Times. Readers in the 1920s and 1930s identified with the citizens of Muncie, Indiana, but they were equally fascinated by the sociological methods and the use of scientific data to define ordinary people in the United States. The book was proof that social data was important—and interesting—to the U.S.\\nFigure 2.9 A classroom in Muncie, Indiana, in 1917, five years before John and Helen Lynd began researching this “typical” U.S. community. (Credit: Don O’Brien/flickr)\\n Case Study\\nSometimes a researcher wants to study one specific person or event. A case study is an in-depth analysis of a single event, situation, or individual. To conduct a case study, a researcher examines existing sources like documents and archival records, conducts interviews, engages in direct observation and even participant observation, if possible.\\n Researchers might use this method to study a single case of a foster child, drug lord, cancer patient, criminal, or rape victim. However, a major criticism of the case study as a method is that while offering depth on a topic, it does not provide enough evidence to form a generalized conclusion. In other words, it is difficult to make universal claims based on just one person, since one person does not verify a pattern. This is why most sociologists do not use case studies as a primary research method.\\n However, case studies are useful when the single case is unique. In these instances, a single case study can contribute tremendous insight. For example, a feral child, also called “wild child,” is one who grows up isolated from human beings.</chunk8>\\n\\n<chunk9>Feral children grow up without social contact and language, which are elements crucial to a “civilized” child’s development. These children mimic the behaviors and movements of animals, and often invent their own language. There are only about one hundred cases of “feral children” in the world.\\n As you may imagine, a feral child is a subject of great interest to researchers. Feral children provide unique information about child development because they have grown up outside of the parameters of “normal” growth and nurturing. And since there are very few feral children, the case study is the most appropriate method for researchers to use in studying the subject.\\n At age three, a Ukranian girl named Oxana Malaya suffered severe parental neglect. She lived in a shed with dogs, and she ate raw meat and scraps. Five years later, a neighbor called authorities and reported seeing a girl who ran on all fours, barking. Officials brought Oxana into society, where she was cared for and taught some human behaviors, but she never became fully socialized. She has been designated as unable to support herself and now lives in a mental institution (Grice 2011). Case studies like this offer a way for sociologists to collect data that may not be obtained by any other method.\\n Experiments\\nYou have probably tested some of your own personal social theories. “If I study at night and review in the morning, I’ll improve my retention skills.” Or, “If I stop drinking soda, I’ll feel better.” Cause and effect. If this, then that. When you test the theory, your results either prove or disprove your hypothesis.\\n One way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment, meaning they investigate relationships to test a hypothesis—a scientific approach.\\n There are two main types of experiments: lab-based experiments and natural or field experiments. In a lab setting, the research can be controlled so that more data can be recorded in a limited amount of time. In a natural or field- based experiment, the time it takes to gather the data cannot be controlled but the information might be considered more accurate since it was collected without interference or intervention by the researcher.\\n As a research method, either type of sociological experiment is useful for testing if-then statements: if a particular thing happens (cause), then another particular thing will result (effect). To set up a lab-based experiment, sociologists create artificial situations that allow them to manipulate variables.\\n Classically, the sociologist selects a set of people with similar characteristics, such as age, class, race, or education. Those people are divided into two groups. One is the experimental group and the other is the control group. The experimental group is exposed to the independent variable(s) and the control group is not. To test the benefits of tutoring, for example, the sociologist might provide tutoring to the experimental group of students but not to the control group. Then both groups would be tested for differences in performance to see if tutoring had an effect on the experimental group of students.</chunk9>\\n\\n<chunk10>As you can imagine, in a case like this, the researcher would not want to jeopardize the accomplishments of either group of students, so the setting would be somewhat artificial. The test would not be for a grade reflected on their permanent record of a student, for example.\\n And if a researcher told the students they would be observed as part of a study on measuring the effectiveness of tutoring, the students might not behave naturally. This is called the Hawthorne effect—which occurs when people change their behavior because they know they are being watched as part of a study. The Hawthorne effect is unavoidable in some research studies because sociologists have to make the purpose of the study known. Subjects must be aware that they are being observed, and a certain amount of artificiality may result (Sonnenfeld 1985).\\n Figure 2.10 Sociologist Frances Heussenstamm conducted research to explore the correlation between traffic stops and race-based bumper stickers. This issue of racial profiling remains a hot-button topic today. (Credit: dwightsghost/flickr)\\n A real-life example will help illustrate the process. In 1971, Frances Heussenstamm, a sociology professor at California State University at Los Angeles, had a theory about police prejudice. To test her theory, she conducted research. She chose fifteen students from three ethnic backgrounds: Black, White, and Hispanic. She chose students who routinely drove to and from campus along Los Angeles freeway routes, and who had had perfect driving records for longer than a year.\\n Next, she placed a Black Panther bumper sticker on each car. That sticker, a representation of a social value, was the independent variable. In the 1970s, the Black Panthers were a revolutionary group actively fighting racism. Heussenstamm asked the students to follow their normal driving patterns. She wanted to see whether seeming support for the Black Panthers would change how these good drivers were treated by the police patrolling the highways. The dependent variable would be the number of traffic stops/citations.\\n The first arrest, for an incorrect lane change, was made two hours after the experiment began. One participant was pulled over three times in three days. He quit the study. After seventeen days, the fifteen drivers had collected a total of thirty-three traffic citations. The research was halted. The funding to pay traffic fines had run out, and so had the enthusiasm of the participants (Heussenstamm, 1971).\\n Secondary Data Analysis\\nWhile sociologists often engage in original research studies, they also contribute knowledge to the discipline through secondary data analysis. Secondary data does not result from firsthand research collected from primary sources, but are the already completed work of other researchers or data collected by an agency or organization. Sociologists might study works written by historians, economists, teachers, or early sociologists. They might search through periodicals, newspapers, or magazines, or organizational data from any period in history.\\n Using available information not only saves time and money but can also add depth to a study. Sociologists often interpret findings in a new way, a way that was not part of an author’s original purpose or intention.</chunk10>\\n\\n<chunk11>To study how women were encouraged to act and behave in the 1960s, for example, a researcher might watch movies, televisions shows, and situation comedies from that period. Or to research changes in behavior and attitudes due to the emergence of television in the late 1950s and early 1960s, a sociologist would rely on new interpretations of secondary data. Decades from now, researchers will most likely conduct similar studies on the advent of mobile phones, the Internet, or social media.\\n Social scientists also learn by analyzing the research of a variety of agencies. Governmental departments and global groups, like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or the World Health Organization (WHO), publish studies with findings that are useful to sociologists. A public statistic like the foreclosure rate might be useful for studying the effects of a recession. A racial demographic profile might be compared with data on education funding to examine the resources accessible by different groups.\\n One of the advantages of secondary data like old movies or WHO statistics is that it is nonreactive research (or unobtrusive research), meaning that it does not involve direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people’s behaviors. Unlike studies requiring direct contact with people, using previously published data does not require entering a population and the investment and risks inherent in that research process.\\n Using available data does have its challenges. Public records are not always easy to access. A researcher will need to do some legwork to track them down and gain access to records. To guide the search through a vast library of materials and avoid wasting time reading unrelated sources, sociologists employ content analysis, applying a systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from secondary data as they relate to the study at hand.\\n Also, in some cases, there is no way to verify the accuracy of existing data. It is easy to count how many drunk drivers, for example, are pulled over by the police. But how many are not? While it’s possible to discover the percentage of teenage students who drop out of high school, it might be more challenging to determine the number who return to school or get their GED later.\\n Another problem arises when data are unavailable in the exact form needed or do not survey the topic from the precise angle the researcher seeks. For example, the average salaries paid to professors at a public school is public record. But these figures do not necessarily reveal how long it took each professor to reach the salary range, what their educational backgrounds are, or how long they’ve been teaching.\\n When conducting content analysis, it is important to consider the date of publication of an existing source and to take into account attitudes and common cultural ideals that may have influenced the research. For example, when Robert S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd gathered research in the 1920s, attitudes and cultural norms were vastly different then than they are now. Beliefs about gender roles, race, education, and work have changed significantly since then. At the time, the study’s purpose was to reveal insights about small U.S. communities. Today, it is an illustration of 1920s attitudes and values.</chunk11>\\n\\n<chunk12></chunk12>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 1 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 1 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

They use research methods to design a study. Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study. Sociologists generally choose from widely used methods of social investigation: primary source data collection such as survey, participant observation, ethnography, case study, unobtrusive observations, experiment, and secondary data analysis, or use of existing sources. Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use. When you are conducting research think about the best way to gather or obtain knowledge about your topic, think of yourself as an architect. An architect needs a blueprint to build a house, as a sociologist your blueprint is your research design including your data collection method.\\n When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being observed. A researcher wouldn’t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, “Any gang members around?”\\n Making sociologists’ presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers can’t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe behaviors or attract attention. In situations like these, other methods are needed. Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics, protect research participants or subjects, and that fit with their overall approaches to research.\\n Surveys\\nAs a research method, a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire or an interview. The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in which they can express personal ideas.\\n Figure 2.3 Questionnaires are a common research method. (Credit: CDC Global/flickr)\\n At some point, most people in the United States respond to some type of survey. The 2020 U.S. Census is an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Since 1790, United States has conducted a survey consisting of six questions to received demographical data pertaining to residents. The questions pertain to the demographics of the residents who live in the United States. Currently, the Census is received by residents in the United Stated and five territories and consists of 12 questions.\\n Not all surveys are considered sociological research, however, and many surveys people commonly encounter focus on identifying marketing needs and strategies rather than testing a hypothesis or contributing to social science knowledge.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nSurveys are described as a popular research method, particularly useful for collecting data on behaviors and opinions. The text contrasts scientific surveys with non-scientific polls, emphasizing the importance of target populations and random sampling in research. The text continues to explore surveys, including the differentiation between quantitative and qualitative data collection, the use of interviews, and the importance of anonymity in obtaining honest responses. The text discusses field research as a method of observing behavior in natural settings, highlighting its value in understanding social interactions but also noting its limitations regarding establishing causality. Participant observation is introduced as a method where researchers immerse themselves in the environments they study, observing behaviors and routines within their natural context. The narrative continues with examples of participant observation, emphasizing its immersive approach to understanding social dynamics, often in covert manners. The section outlines ethnography, focusing on its immersive nature and the insights it provides into communities' cultures and social structures. It also introduces institutional ethnography as a feminist-inspired approach. The Lynds' ethnographic study of Muncie, Indiana, is detailed, exploring the effects of industrialization and urbanization on American life and sparking broader interest in sociological data. The text discusses case studies, noting their in-depth insights but limited generalizability. The use of experiments to test hypotheses in controlled settings is also introduced. Experiments are further explored, including potential observer effects. An example of a field experiment testing police prejudice is provided. Secondary data analysis is introduced as a method of utilizing existing data. The section concludes with the benefits and challenges of secondary data analysis, emphasizing its nonreactive nature and the importance of systematic content analysis.

This is because chronic stress leads to an overproduction of cortisol, a hormone that, in excessive amounts, has been linked to neural atrophy in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory formation.\"\\nLiteral Question:\\n\"What is one effect of chronic stress on the brain?\"\\n(Answer: Neural atrophy in the hippocampus, affecting memory formation.)\\nInferential Question:\\n\"Why might individuals in high-stress professions experience difficulty making decisions?\"\\n(Reasoning and Answer: The passage states that chronic stress impairs cognitive functions like decision-making. Since high-stress professions expose individuals to prolonged stress, they may experience cognitive difficulties due to excessive cortisol affecting brain regions involved in these functions.)\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Summarize your understanding of what inferential questions are. \\nStep2: Based on the inference, source text, and contextual text, write a question about the inference. \\n  - Focus the question on the inference.\\n  - Use clear and concise language; avoid overly complex or wordy constructions.\\n  - Omit unnecessary introductory phrases such as \"According to the text,\" \"Based on the source,\" or \"According to the passage\\nStep3: Provide a correct answer to the inferential question based on the inference, the source text, and the contextual text. The correct answer should:\\n  - Be indisputably correct based on the text.\\n  - Try not to use words that are in the question.\\n  - Avoid wording that could make multiple answers seem correct.\\nStep4: Provide three plausible distractors based on the text. The distractors should:\\n  - Avoid obviously wrong or ridiculous choices.\\n  - Be plausible and logically parallel but incorrect based on the text. \\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer. \\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      Example: \\n      Why is peer review important in academic research?\\n        A) It ensures that every mistake is caught before publication. (Unrealistic exaggeration.)\\n        B) It contributes to the credibility and validity of research. (correct answer)\\n        C) It completely eliminates the risk of bias. (Overly absolute, sounds implausible.)\\n        D) It allows only the best scientists to publish. (Overgeneralized and elitist; not a common misconception.)\\n      Note: The distractors are poor because they do not mirror student thinking—they simply sound extreme or silly, weakening the item\\'s quality.\\n  **Example with good distractors**\\n    What can be inferred about the effects of confirmation bias on how people process new information?\\n      A) People are generally open to changing their beliefs when presented with neutral evidence. (distractor)\\n      B) Confirmation bias can cause people to misinterpret information that contradicts their existing beliefs. (correct answer)\\n      C) The presence of conflicting data usually prompts people to reevaluate their assumptions objectively. (distractor)\\n      D) Individuals who hold strong opinions are less likely to be influenced by various types of evidence. (distractor)\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice inferential question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice inferential question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the likely cause of the decrease in energy at each succeeding trophic level in an ecosystem?\\n  \\\\nA) The inefficient capture and consumption of food by organisms\\n  \\\\nB) The availability of sunlight for photosynthesis\\n  \\\\nC) The decrease in the number of autotrophs\\n  \\\\nD) The high metabolic rate of consumers</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags. The answer should contain the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D) and the text of the correct answer. Example:\\n<ANSWER>A) The inefficient capture and consumption of food by organisms</ANSWER>\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Here is an inference:\\n<inference>\\nField research and participant observation are effective for understanding complex social behaviors in natural settings but may not establish clear causality due to variable complexity.\\n</inference>\\n\\nHere is the source text for the inference:\\n<source_text>\\nThe researcher interacts with or observes people and gathers data along the way. The key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject’s natural environment, whether it’s a coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.\\n Figure 2.5 Sociological researchers travel across countries and cultures to interact with and observe subjects in their natural environments. (Credit: IMLS Digital Collections and Content/flickr)\\n While field research often begins in a specific setting, the study’s purpose is to observe specific behaviors in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing how people think and behave. It seeks to understand why they behave that way. However, researchers may struggle to narrow down cause and effect when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment. And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables. Indeed, much of the data gathered in sociology do not identify a cause and effect but a correlation.\\n Figure 2.6 Researchers have used surveys and participant observations to accumulate data on Lady Gaga and Beyonce as multifaceted performers. (Credit a: John Robert Chartlon/flickr, b: Kristopher Harris/flickr.)\\n Sociologists have studied Lady Gaga and Beyoncé and their impact on music, movies, social media, fan participation, and social equality. In their studies, researchers have used several research methods including secondary analysis, participant observation, and surveys from concert participants.\\n In their study, Click, Lee & Holiday (2013) interviewed 45 Lady Gaga fans who utilized social media to communicate with the artist. These fans viewed Lady Gaga as a mirror of themselves and a source of inspiration. Like her, they embrace not being a part of mainstream culture. Many of Lady Gaga’s fans are members of the LGBTQ community. They see the “song “Born This Way” as a rallying cry and answer her calls for “Paws Up” with a physical expression of solidarity—outstretched arms and ﬁngers bent and curled to resemble monster claws.”\\n Sascha Buchanan (2019) made use of participant observation to study the relationship between two fan groups, that of Beyoncé and that of Rihanna. She observed award shows sponsored by iHeartRadio, MTV EMA, and BET that pit one group against another as they competed for Best Fan Army, Biggest Fans, and FANdemonium. Buchanan argues that the media thus sustains a myth of rivalry between the two most commercially successful Black women vocal artists.\\nParticipant Observation\\nIn 2000, a comic writer named Rodney Rothman wanted an insider’s view of white-collar work. He slipped into the sterile, high-rise offices of a New York “dot com” agency. Every day for two weeks, he pretended to work there. His main purpose was simply to see whether anyone would notice him or challenge his presence. No one did. The receptionist greeted him. The employees smiled and said good morning. Rothman was accepted as part of the team. He even went so far as to claim a desk, inform the receptionist of his whereabouts, and attend a meeting. He published an article about his experience in The New Yorker called “My Fake Job” (2000). Later, he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology. However, Rothman’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “dot com” company and exemplified the lengths to which a writer, or a sociologist, will go to uncover material.\\n Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation, in which researchers join people and participate in a group’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context. This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life. A researcher might go to great lengths to get a firsthand look into a trend, institution, or behavior. A researcher might work as a waitress in a diner, experience homelessness for several weeks, or ride along with police officers as they patrol their regular beat. Often, these researchers try to blend in seamlessly with the population they study, and they may not disclose their true identity or purpose if they feel it would compromise the results of their research.\\n Figure 2.7 Is she a working waitress or a sociologist conducting a study using participant observation? A field researcher may take a job or take other steps to get firsthand knowledge of their subjects. (Credit: Gareth Williams/flickr.)\\n At the beginning of a field study, researchers might have a question: “What really goes on in the kitchen of the most popular diner on campus?” or “What is it like to be homeless?” Participant observation is a useful method if the researcher wants to explore a certain environment from the inside.\\n Field researchers simply want to observe and learn. In such a setting, the researcher will be alert and open minded to whatever happens, recording all observations accurately. Soon, as patterns emerge, questions will become more specific, observations will lead to hypotheses, and hypotheses will guide the researcher in analyzing data and generating results.\\n In a study of small towns in the United States conducted by sociological researchers John S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd, the team altered their purpose as they gathered data. They initially planned to focus their study on the role of religion in U.S. towns. As they gathered observations, they realized that the effect of industrialization and urbanization was the more relevant topic of this social group. The Lynds did not change their methods, but they revised the purpose of their study.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nThis section provides learning objectives for understanding research methods in sociology, including the scientific method and different types of research approaches.

It outlines the importance of choosing appropriate methods and the considerations sociologists must take when conducting research, especially in social environments.   Surveys are described as a popular research method, particularly useful for collecting data on behaviors and opinions. The text contrasts scientific surveys with non-scientific polls, emphasizing the importance of target populations and random sampling in research.   The text continues to explore surveys, including the differentiation between quantitative and qualitative data collection, the use of interviews, and the importance of anonymity in obtaining honest responses.   The text discusses field research as a method of observing behavior in natural settings, highlighting its value in understanding social interactions but also noting its limitations regarding establishing causality.   Participant observation is introduced as a method where researchers immerse themselves in the environments they study, observing behaviors and routines within their natural context.   The narrative continues with examples of participant observation, emphasizing its immersive approach to understanding social dynamics, often in covert manners.   The section outlines ethnography, focusing on its immersive nature and the insights it provides into communities' cultures and social structures. It also introduces institutional ethnography as a feminist-inspired approach.   The Lynds' ethnographic study of Muncie, Indiana, is detailed, exploring the effects of industrialization and urbanization on American life and sparking broader interest in sociological data.   The text discusses case studies, noting their in-depth insights but limited generalizability. The use of experiments to test hypotheses in controlled settings is also introduced.   Experiments are further explored, including potential observer effects. An example of a field experiment testing police prejudice is provided. Secondary data analysis is introduced as a method of utilizing existing data.   The section concludes with the benefits and challenges of secondary data analysis, emphasizing its nonreactive nature and the importance of systematic content analysis.

They use research methods to design a study. Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study. Sociologists generally choose from widely used methods of social investigation: primary source data collection such as survey, participant observation, ethnography, case study, unobtrusive observations, experiment, and secondary data analysis, or use of existing sources. Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use. When you are conducting research think about the best way to gather or obtain knowledge about your topic, think of yourself as an architect. An architect needs a blueprint to build a house, as a sociologist your blueprint is your research design including your data collection method.\\n When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being observed. A researcher wouldn’t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, “Any gang members around?”\\n Making sociologists’ presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers can’t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe behaviors or attract attention. In situations like these, other methods are needed. Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics, protect research participants or subjects, and that fit with their overall approaches to research.\\n Surveys\\nAs a research method, a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire or an interview. The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in which they can express personal ideas.\\n Figure 2.3 Questionnaires are a common research method. (Credit: CDC Global/flickr)\\n At some point, most people in the United States respond to some type of survey. The 2020 U.S. Census is an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Since 1790, United States has conducted a survey consisting of six questions to received demographical data pertaining to residents. The questions pertain to the demographics of the residents who live in the United States. Currently, the Census is received by residents in the United Stated and five territories and consists of 12 questions.\\n Not all surveys are considered sociological research, however, and many surveys people commonly encounter focus on identifying marketing needs and strategies rather than testing a hypothesis or contributing to social science knowledge.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\nSurveys are described as a popular research method, particularly useful for collecting data on behaviors and opinions.

The key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject’s natural environment, whether it’s a coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.\\n Figure 2.5 Sociological researchers travel across countries and cultures to interact with and observe subjects in their natural environments. (Credit: IMLS Digital Collections and Content/flickr)\\n While field research often begins in a specific setting, the study’s purpose is to observe specific behaviors in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing how people think and behave. It seeks to understand why they behave that way. However, researchers may struggle to narrow down cause and effect when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment. And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables. Indeed, much of the data gathered in sociology do not identify a cause and effect but a correlation.\\n Figure 2.6 Researchers have used surveys and participant observations to accumulate data on Lady Gaga and Beyonce as multifaceted performers. (Credit a: John Robert Chartlon/flickr, b: Kristopher Harris/flickr.)\\n Sociologists have studied Lady Gaga and Beyoncé and their impact on music, movies, social media, fan participation, and social equality. In their studies, researchers have used several research methods including secondary analysis, participant observation, and surveys from concert participants.\\n In their study, Click, Lee & Holiday (2013) interviewed 45 Lady Gaga fans who utilized social media to communicate with the artist. These fans viewed Lady Gaga as a mirror of themselves and a source of inspiration. Like her, they embrace not being a part of mainstream culture. Many of Lady Gaga’s fans are members of the LGBTQ community. They see the “song “Born This Way” as a rallying cry and answer her calls for “Paws Up” with a physical expression of solidarity—outstretched arms and ﬁngers bent and curled to resemble monster claws.”\\n Sascha Buchanan (2019) made use of participant observation to study the relationship between two fan groups, that of Beyoncé and that of Rihanna. She observed award shows sponsored by iHeartRadio, MTV EMA, and BET that pit one group against another as they competed for Best Fan Army, Biggest Fans, and FANdemonium. Buchanan argues that the media thus sustains a myth of rivalry between the two most commercially successful Black women vocal artists.\\nParticipant Observation\\nIn 2000, a comic writer named Rodney Rothman wanted an insider’s view of white-collar work. He slipped into the sterile, high-rise offices of a New York “dot com” agency. Every day for two weeks, he pretended to work there. His main purpose was simply to see whether anyone would notice him or challenge his presence. No one did. The receptionist greeted him. The employees smiled and said good morning. Rothman was accepted as part of the team. He even went so far as to claim a desk, inform the receptionist of his whereabouts, and attend a meeting. He published an article about his experience in The New Yorker called “My Fake Job” (2000). Later, he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology. However, Rothman’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “dot com” company and exemplified the lengths to which a writer, or a sociologist, will go to uncover material.\\n Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation, in which researchers join people and participate in a group’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context. This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life. A researcher might go to great lengths to get a firsthand look into a trend, institution, or behavior. A researcher might work as a waitress in a diner, experience homelessness for several weeks, or ride along with police officers as they patrol their regular beat. Often, these researchers try to blend in seamlessly with the population they study, and they may not disclose their true identity or purpose if they feel it would compromise the results of their research.\\n Figure 2.7 Is she a working waitress or a sociologist conducting a study using participant observation? A field researcher may take a job or take other steps to get firsthand knowledge of their subjects. (Credit: Gareth Williams/flickr.)\\n At the beginning of a field study, researchers might have a question: “What really goes on in the kitchen of the most popular diner on campus?” or “What is it like to be homeless?” Participant observation is a useful method if the researcher wants to explore a certain environment from the inside.\\n Field researchers simply want to observe and learn. In such a setting, the researcher will be alert and open minded to whatever happens, recording all observations accurately. Soon, as patterns emerge, questions will become more specific, observations will lead to hypotheses, and hypotheses will guide the researcher in analyzing data and generating results.\\n In a study of small towns in the United States conducted by sociological researchers John S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd, the team altered their purpose as they gathered data. They initially planned to focus their study on the role of religion in U.S. towns. As they gathered observations, they realized that the effect of industrialization and urbanization was the more relevant topic of this social group. The Lynds did not change their methods, but they revised the purpose of their study.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\nThis section provides learning objectives for understanding research methods in sociology, including the scientific method and different types of research approaches.

The correct answer should:\\n  - Be indisputably correct based on the text.\\n  - Try not to use words that are in the question.\\n  - Avoid wording that could make multiple answers seem correct.\\nStep3: Provide three plausible distractors based on the text. The distractors should:\\n  - Avoid obviously wrong or ridiculous choices.\\n  - Be plausible and logically parallel but incorrect based on the text. \\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer. \\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid absolute terms (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags.

(Overly absolute, sounds implausible.)\\n      D) It allows only the best scientists to publish. (Overgeneralized and elitist; not a common misconception.)\\n      The distractors are poor because they do not mirror student thinking—they simply sound extreme or silly, weakening the item\\'s quality.\\n  **Example with good distractors**\\n    which of the following best illustrates the role of peer groups in the socialization process?\\n      A) Teaching a child the formal rules of grammar and writing. (distractor)\\n      B) Reinforcing cultural norms through interaction with age-mates. (correct answer)\\n      C) Broadcasting societal ideals through scripted television shows. (distractor)\\n      D) Imposing institutional discipline through structured authority. (distractor)\\nStep4: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep5: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice factual question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice factual question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags.

They use research methods to design a study. Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study. Sociologists generally choose from widely used methods of social investigation: primary source data collection such as survey, participant observation, ethnography, case study, unobtrusive observations, experiment, and secondary data analysis, or use of existing sources. Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use. When you are conducting research think about the best way to gather or obtain knowledge about your topic, think of yourself as an architect. An architect needs a blueprint to build a house, as a sociologist your blueprint is your research design including your data collection method.\\n When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being observed. A researcher wouldn’t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, “Any gang members around?”\\n Making sociologists’ presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers can’t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe behaviors or attract attention. In situations like these, other methods are needed. Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics, protect research participants or subjects, and that fit with their overall approaches to research.\\n Surveys\\nAs a research method, a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire or an interview. The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in which they can express personal ideas.\\n Figure 2.3 Questionnaires are a common research method. (Credit: CDC Global/flickr)\\n At some point, most people in the United States respond to some type of survey. The 2020 U.S. Census is an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Since 1790, United States has conducted a survey consisting of six questions to received demographical data pertaining to residents. The questions pertain to the demographics of the residents who live in the United States. Currently, the Census is received by residents in the United Stated and five territories and consists of 12 questions.\\n Not all surveys are considered sociological research, however, and many surveys people commonly encounter focus on identifying marketing needs and strategies rather than testing a hypothesis or contributing to social science knowledge.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nSurveys are described as a popular research method, particularly useful for collecting data on behaviors and opinions.

You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYour task is to write an inferential multiple-choice question (see [DEFINITION]) based on an inference provided by the user. \\nThis inference will be directly supported by a \"source text\", which is an excerpt from the academic material. \\nA \"contextual text\" will also be provided to help you understand the broader meaning and useage of the source text. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\nNOTE: The user may provide an already generated question with evaluations, in which case you should revise the provided question based on the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] and the evaluations.\\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are inferential questions?**\\nInferential questions require students to go beyond the explicit information in a text and draw conclusions based on evidence, reasoning, and prior knowledge. Unlike literal questions, which ask for directly stated facts, inferential questions challenge students to interpret, analyze, or predict based on textual clues.\\nFor example, \\nExcerpt:\\n\"Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to stress can negatively impact cognitive function, particularly memory and decision-making. This is because chronic stress leads to an overproduction of cortisol, a hormone that, in excessive amounts, has been linked to neural atrophy in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory formation.\"\\nLiteral Question:\\n\"What is one effect of chronic stress on the brain?\"\\n(Answer: Neural atrophy in the hippocampus, affecting memory formation.)\\nInferential Question:\\n\"Why might individuals in high-stress professions experience difficulty making decisions?\"\\n(Reasoning and Answer: The passage states that chronic stress impairs cognitive functions like decision-making. Since high-stress professions expose individuals to prolonged stress, they may experience cognitive difficulties due to excessive cortisol affecting brain regions involved in these functions.)\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Summarize your understanding of what inferential questions are. \\nStep2: Based on the inference, source text, and contextual text, write a question about the inference. \\n  - Focus the question on the inference.\\n  - Use clear and concise language; avoid overly complex or wordy constructions.\\n  - Omit unnecessary introductory phrases such as \"According to the text,\" \"Based on the source,\" or \"According to the passage\\nStep3: Provide a correct answer to the inferential question based on the inference, the source text, and the contextual text. The correct answer should:\\n  - Be indisputably correct based on the text.\\n  - Try not to use words that are in the question.\\n  - Avoid wording that could make multiple answers seem correct.\\nStep4: Provide three plausible distractors based on the text. The distractors should:\\n  - Avoid obviously wrong or ridiculous choices.\\n  - Be plausible and logically parallel but incorrect based on the text. \\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer. \\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      Example: \\n      Why is peer review important in academic research?\\n        A) It ensures that every mistake is caught before publication. (Unrealistic exaggeration.)\\n        B) It contributes to the credibility and validity of research. (correct answer)\\n        C) It completely eliminates the risk of bias. (Overly absolute, sounds implausible.)\\n        D) It allows only the best scientists to publish. (Overgeneralized and elitist; not a common misconception.)\\n      Note: The distractors are poor because they do not mirror student thinking—they simply sound extreme or silly, weakening the item\\'s quality.\\n  **Example with good distractors**\\n    What can be inferred about the effects of confirmation bias on how people process new information?\\n      A) People are generally open to changing their beliefs when presented with neutral evidence. (distractor)\\n      B) Confirmation bias can cause people to misinterpret information that contradicts their existing beliefs. (correct answer)\\n      C) The presence of conflicting data usually prompts people to reevaluate their assumptions objectively. (distractor)\\n      D) Individuals who hold strong opinions are less likely to be influenced by various types of evidence. (distractor)\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice inferential question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice inferential question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags.

The key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject’s natural environment, whether it’s a coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.\\n Figure 2.5 Sociological researchers travel across countries and cultures to interact with and observe subjects in their natural environments. (Credit: IMLS Digital Collections and Content/flickr)\\n While field research often begins in a specific setting, the study’s purpose is to observe specific behaviors in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing how people think and behave. It seeks to understand why they behave that way. However, researchers may struggle to narrow down cause and effect when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment. And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables. Indeed, much of the data gathered in sociology do not identify a cause and effect but a correlation.\\n Figure 2.6 Researchers have used surveys and participant observations to accumulate data on Lady Gaga and Beyonce as multifaceted performers. (Credit a: John Robert Chartlon/flickr, b: Kristopher Harris/flickr.)\\n Sociologists have studied Lady Gaga and Beyoncé and their impact on music, movies, social media, fan participation, and social equality. In their studies, researchers have used several research methods including secondary analysis, participant observation, and surveys from concert participants.\\n In their study, Click, Lee & Holiday (2013) interviewed 45 Lady Gaga fans who utilized social media to communicate with the artist. These fans viewed Lady Gaga as a mirror of themselves and a source of inspiration. Like her, they embrace not being a part of mainstream culture. Many of Lady Gaga’s fans are members of the LGBTQ community. They see the “song “Born This Way” as a rallying cry and answer her calls for “Paws Up” with a physical expression of solidarity—outstretched arms and ﬁngers bent and curled to resemble monster claws.”\\n Sascha Buchanan (2019) made use of participant observation to study the relationship between two fan groups, that of Beyoncé and that of Rihanna. She observed award shows sponsored by iHeartRadio, MTV EMA, and BET that pit one group against another as they competed for Best Fan Army, Biggest Fans, and FANdemonium. Buchanan argues that the media thus sustains a myth of rivalry between the two most commercially successful Black women vocal artists.\\nParticipant Observation\\nIn 2000, a comic writer named Rodney Rothman wanted an insider’s view of white-collar work. He slipped into the sterile, high-rise offices of a New York “dot com” agency. Every day for two weeks, he pretended to work there. His main purpose was simply to see whether anyone would notice him or challenge his presence. No one did. The receptionist greeted him. The employees smiled and said good morning. Rothman was accepted as part of the team. He even went so far as to claim a desk, inform the receptionist of his whereabouts, and attend a meeting. He published an article about his experience in The New Yorker called “My Fake Job” (2000). Later, he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology. However, Rothman’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “dot com” company and exemplified the lengths to which a writer, or a sociologist, will go to uncover material.\\n Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation, in which researchers join people and participate in a group’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context. This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life. A researcher might go to great lengths to get a firsthand look into a trend, institution, or behavior. A researcher might work as a waitress in a diner, experience homelessness for several weeks, or ride along with police officers as they patrol their regular beat. Often, these researchers try to blend in seamlessly with the population they study, and they may not disclose their true identity or purpose if they feel it would compromise the results of their research.\\n Figure 2.7 Is she a working waitress or a sociologist conducting a study using participant observation? A field researcher may take a job or take other steps to get firsthand knowledge of their subjects. (Credit: Gareth Williams/flickr.)\\n At the beginning of a field study, researchers might have a question: “What really goes on in the kitchen of the most popular diner on campus?” or “What is it like to be homeless?” Participant observation is a useful method if the researcher wants to explore a certain environment from the inside.\\n Field researchers simply want to observe and learn. In such a setting, the researcher will be alert and open minded to whatever happens, recording all observations accurately. Soon, as patterns emerge, questions will become more specific, observations will lead to hypotheses, and hypotheses will guide the researcher in analyzing data and generating results.\\n In a study of small towns in the United States conducted by sociological researchers John S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd, the team altered their purpose as they gathered data. They initially planned to focus their study on the role of religion in U.S. towns. As they gathered observations, they realized that the effect of industrialization and urbanization was the more relevant topic of this social group. The Lynds did not change their methods, but they revised the purpose of their study.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nThis section provides learning objectives for understanding research methods in sociology, including the scientific method and different types of research approaches. It outlines the importance of choosing appropriate methods and the considerations sociologists must take when conducting research, especially in social environments. Surveys are described as a popular research method, particularly useful for collecting data on behaviors and opinions. The text contrasts scientific surveys with non-scientific polls, emphasizing the importance of target populations and random sampling in research. The text continues to explore surveys, including the differentiation between quantitative and qualitative data collection, the use of interviews, and the importance of anonymity in obtaining honest responses. The narrative continues with examples of participant observation, emphasizing its immersive approach to understanding social dynamics, often in covert manners. The section outlines ethnography, focusing on its immersive nature and the insights it provides into communities' cultures and social structures. It also introduces institutional ethnography as a feminist-inspired approach. The Lynds' ethnographic study of Muncie, Indiana, is detailed, exploring the effects of industrialization and urbanization on American life and sparking broader interest in sociological data. The text discusses case studies, noting their in-depth insights but limited generalizability. The use of experiments to test hypotheses in controlled settings is also introduced. Experiments are further explored, including potential observer effects. An example of a field experiment testing police prejudice is provided. Secondary data analysis is introduced as a method of utilizing existing data. The section concludes with the benefits and challenges of secondary data analysis, emphasizing its nonreactive nature and the importance of systematic content analysis.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text.

Value does not mean monetary worth in sociology, but rather ideals, or principles and standards members of a culture hold in high regard. Most cultures in any society hold “knowledge” (education) in high regard. Values are deeply embedded and are critical for learning a culture’s beliefs, which are the tenets or convictions that people hold to be true. Individual cultures in a society have personal beliefs, but they also shared collective values. To illustrate the difference, U.S. citizens may believe in the American Dream—that anyone who works hard enough will be successful and wealthy. Underlying this belief is the American value that wealth is important. In other cultures, success may be tied less to wealth and more to having many healthy children. Values shape a society by suggesting what is good and bad, beautiful and ugly, sought or avoided.\\n Consider the value that the U.S. places upon youth. Children represent innocence and purity, while a youthful adult appearance signifies sexuality. Shaped by this value, individuals spend millions of dollars each year on cosmetic products and surgeries to look young and beautiful. The U.S. also has an individualistic culture, meaning people place a high value on individuality and independence. In contrast, many other cultures are collectivist, meaning the welfare of the group takes priority over that of the individual. Fulfilling a society’s values can be difficult. Marital monogamy is valued, but many spouses engage in infidelity. Cultural diversity and equal opportunities for all people are valued in the U.S., yet the country’s highest political offices have been dominated by white men.\\n Values often suggest how people should behave, but they don’t accurately reflect how people do behave. Values portray an ideal culture, the standards society would like to embrace and live up to. But ideal culture differs from real culture. In an ideal culture, there would be no traffic accidents, murders, poverty, or racial tension. But in real culture, police officers, lawmakers, educators, and social workers constantly strive to prevent or address these issues. American teenagers are encouraged to value celibacy. However, the number of unplanned pregnancies among teens reveals that the ideal alone is not enough to spare teenagers the potential consequences of having sex.\\n One of the ways societies strive to maintain its values is through rewards and punishments. When people observe the norms of society and uphold its values, they are often rewarded. A boy who helps an elderly woman board a bus may receive a smile and a “thank you.” A business manager who raises profit margins may receive a quarterly bonus. People sanction unwanted or inappropriate behaviors by withholding support, approval, or permission, or by implementing sanctions. We may think of ‘sanction’ as a negative term, but sanctions are forms of social control, ways to encourage conformity to cultural norms or rules.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Sometimes people conform to norms in anticipation or expectation of positive sanctions. Receiving good grades, for instance, may mean praise from parents and teachers. Sanctions can also be negative. A boy who shoves an elderly woman aside to board the bus first may receive frowns or even a scolding from other passengers. A business manager who drives away customers will likely be fired. Breaking norms and rejecting values can lead to cultural sanctions such as earning a negative label like ‘lazy’ or to legal sanctions, such as traffic tickets, fines, or imprisonment. Utilizing social control encourages most people to conform regardless of whether authority figures (such as law enforcement) are present.\\n Values are not static. They change across time and between groups as people evaluate, debate, and change collective social beliefs. Values also vary from culture to culture. For example, cultures differ in their values about what kinds of physical closeness are appropriate in public. It’s rare to see two male friends or coworkers holding hands in the U.S. where that behavior often symbolizes romantic feelings. But in many nations, masculine physical intimacy is considered natural in public. This difference in cultural values came to light when people reacted to photos of former president G.W. Bush holding hands with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in 2005. Simple gestures, such as hand-holding, carry great symbolic differences across cultures.\\n \\n Figure 3.5 In many parts of Africa and the Middle East, it is considered normal for men to hold hands in friendship. How would US citizens react to these two soldiers?

These examples describe the visible and invisible rules of conduct through which societies are structured, or what sociologists call norms. Norms are behaviors that reflect compliance with what cultures and societies have defined as good, right, and important. Most members adhere to them.\\n Formal norms are established, written rules existing in all societies. They support many social institutions, such as the military, criminal justice and healthcare systems, and public schools. Functionalists may question what purpose these norms serve, conflict theorists might be interested in who creates, benefits, and suffers under these formal norms, and symbolic interactionists wonder about how a group that benefits interacts. Laws are formal norms, but so are employee manuals, college entrance exam requirements, and “no running” signs at swimming pools. Formal norms are the most specific and clearly stated of the various types of norms, and they are the most strictly enforced. But they are enforced to varying degrees.\\n For example, private property is highly valued in the U.S. Thieves can be fined, imprisoned, or both. People safeguard valuable possessions by locking their doors, buying a safe, and installing alarm systems on homes and cars. A less strictly enforced social norm is driving while intoxicated. While it’s against the law to drive drunk, drinking is for the most part an acceptable social behavior. And though there are laws to punish drunk driving, there are few systems in place to prevent the crime.\\n</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>There are plenty of formal norms, but the list of informal norms—casual behaviors that are generally and widely conformed to—is longer. People learn informal norms by observation, imitation, and general socialization. Some informal norms are taught directly— “Kiss your Aunt Edna” or “Use your napkin”—while others are learned by observation, including understanding consequences when someone else violates a norm. Informal norms dictate appropriate behaviors without the need of written rules and so may be difficult to learn when you are new to or not familiar with the culture.\\n Although informal norms define personal interactions, they extend into other systems as well. In the U.S., there are informal norms regarding behavior at fast food restaurants. Customers line up to order their food and leave when they are done. They don’t sit down at a table with strangers, sing loudly as they prepare their condiments, or nap in a booth. Most people don’t commit even harmless breaches of informal norms.\\n SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH\\nBreaching Experiments\\nSociologist Harold Garfinkel (1917–2011) studied people’s customs in order to find out how societal rules and norms not only influence behavior but also shape social order. He believed that members of society together create a social order (Weber, 2011). His resulting book, Studies in Ethno-methodology (1967) discusses people’s assumptions about the social makeup of their communities.\\n One of Garfinkel’s research methods was known as a “breaching experiment,” in which the researcher behaves in a socially awkward manner in order to test the sociological concepts of social norms and conformity. The participants are not aware an experiment is in progress, but their response is recorded. For example, if the experimenter is, say, a man in a business suit, and he skips down the sidewalk or hops on one foot, a passersby is likely to stare at him with surprised expressions. But the experimenter does not simply “act weird” in public. Rather, the point is to deviate from a specific social norm in a small way, to subtly break some form of social etiquette, and see what happens.\\n For example, he set up a simple game of tic-tac-toe. One player was asked beforehand to mark Xs and Os not in the boxes but on the lines dividing the spaces instead. The other player, in the dark about the study, was flabbergasted and did not know how to continue. The second player’s outrage, anger, puzzlement, or other emotion suggested that a cultural norms had been violated.\\n There are many rules about speaking with strangers in public. It is okay to tell a woman you like her shoes. It is not okay to ask if you can try them on. It is okay to stand in line behind someone at the ATM. It is not okay to look over his shoulder as he makes a transaction. It is okay to sit beside someone on a crowded bus. It’s weird to sit beside a stranger in a half-empty bus.\\n For some breaches, the researcher directly engages with innocent bystanders. An experimenter might strike up a conversation in a public bathroom, where it’s common to respect each other’s privacy.</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>In a grocery store, an experimenter might take a food item out of another person’s grocery cart, saying, “That looks good! I think I’ll try it.” An experimenter might sit down at a table with others in a fast-food restaurant or follow someone around a museum and study the same paintings. In those cases, the bystanders are pressured to respond, and their discomfort illustrates how much we depend on social norms. Breaching experiments uncover and explore the many unwritten social rules we live by.\\n Norms may be further classified as either mores or folkways. Mores (mor-ays) are norms that embody the moral views and principles of a group. They often have a religious foundation. Violating them can have serious consequences. The strongest mores are protected with laws and other formal sanctions. In most societies, for instance, homicide is considered immoral, and it’s punishable by law (a formal norm). But more often, mores are judged and guarded by public sentiment (an informal norm). People who violate mores are seen as shameful. They can even be shunned or banned from some groups.\\n The mores of the U.S. school system require that a student’s writing be in the student’s own words or use special forms (such as quotation marks and a whole system of citation) for crediting other writers. Submitting or publishing another person’s words as if they are one’s own has a name—plagiarism. The consequences for violating this norm are often severe and can result in expulsion from school or termination from employment.\\n Unlike mores, folkways are norms without any moral underpinnings. Rather, folkways direct appropriate behavior in the day-to-day practices and expressions of a culture. We can think of them as ‘traditions’—things we do because we ‘always have.’ They indicate whether to shake hands or kiss on the cheek when greeting another person. They specify whether to wear a tie and blazer or a T-shirt and sandals to an event. In Canada, women can smile and say hello to men on the street. In Egypt, that’s not acceptable. In regions in the southern U.S., bumping into an acquaintance means stopping to chat. It’s considered rude not to, no matter how busy one is. In other regions, people guard their privacy and value time efficiency. A simple nod of the head is enough. Other accepted folkways in the U.S. may include holding the door open for a stranger or giving someone a gift on their birthday. The rules regarding these folkways may change from culture to culture. A folkway in one culture could be extremely rude in another.\\n Folkways are actions that people everywhere take for granted. People need to act without thinking in order to get seamlessly through daily routines. They can’t stop and analyze every action (Sumner, 1906). Folkways might be small actions, learned by observation and imitated, but they are by no means trivial. An important folkway in many cultures is kissing Grandmother on the cheek. Fail to do so and you will likely be scolded.\\n Symbols and Culture\\nHumans, consciously and subconsciously, are always striving to make sense of their surrounding world.</chunk4>\\n\\n<chunk5>Symbols—such as gestures, signs, objects, signals, and words—help people understand that world. They provide communication methods to understanding experiences by conveying recognizable meanings that are shared by societies.\\n The world is filled with symbols. Sports uniforms, company logos, and traffic signs are symbols. In some cultures, a gold ring is a symbol of marriage. Some symbols are highly functional; stop signs, for instance, provide useful instruction. As physical objects, they belong to material culture, but because they function as symbols, they also convey nonmaterial cultural meanings. Some symbols are valuable only in what they represent. Trophies, blue ribbons, or gold medals, for example, represent accomplishments. But many objects have both material and nonmaterial symbolic value.\\n \\n Figure 3.6 Some road signs are universal. But how would you interpret the signage on the right? (Credit: (a) Andrew Bain/flickr; (b) HonzaSoukup/flickr)\\nSymbols often get noticed when they are out of context. Used unconventionally, they convey strong messages. A stop sign placed on the door of a college building makes a political statement, as does a camouflage military jacket worn in an antiwar protest. Together, the semaphore signals for “N” and “D” represent nuclear disarmament—and form the well-known peace sign (Westcott, 2008). Some college students wear pajamas and bedroom slippers to class, clothing that was formerly associated only with privacy and bedtime. By wearing the outfit, students are defying traditional cultural norms.\\n Some symbols represent only one side of the story and elicit strong emotions, which can lead to social unrest. Their presence is a reminder of a nation’s worst times and not something to celebrate. Many of these symbols are targets of vandalism as the destruction of these representations is symbolic. Effigies representing public figures are burned to demonstrate anger at certain leaders. In 1989, crowds tore down the Berlin Wall, a decades-old symbol of the division between East and West Germany, communism, and capitalism. In the U.S. beginning in 2019, statues associated with slavery and the Civil War were removed from state capitols, college campuses, and public parks. In Germany, any display of Hitler or Nazi memorabilia or to deny the Holocaust is illegal.\\n While different cultures have varying systems of symbols, one system is common to all: language. Whatever its form, people learn social and cultural norms through it.\\n Language and Symbols\\nLanguage is a system that uses symbols with which people communicate and through which culture is transmitted. Letters (which make up words), pictographs, and hand gestures are all symbols that create a language used for communication. Sign language, for example, requires an intimate knowledge not only of an alphabet but also of signs that represent entire words and the meaning indicated by certain facial expressions or postures. Its grammar differs from the spoken language. As spoken language is different across regions, nations and cultures, and can even differ by the age of the person, so too does sign language.\\n All language systems contain the same basic elements that are effective in communicating ideas - object, subject, action.</chunk5>\\n\\n<chunk6>A written language system consists of symbols that refer to spoken sound. Taken together, these symbols convey specific meanings. The English language uses a combination of twenty-six letters to create words. These twenty-six letters make up over 600,000 recognized words (OED Online, 2011). We can compare the reliance on tone and inflection to Mandarin Chinese. It contains over 8,000 characters, but the same character may symbolize different concepts depending on the tone used.\\n English today contains an English and French version for the same concept. For example, in the English version, one eats, but in French version, one dines. In the English version, we meet someone. In the French version, we encounter someone. Readers of American English may be surprised by the inclusion of a ‘u’ in some spellings of words like ‘behaviour’ or ‘flavour.’ Americans have dropped that ‘u’ that writers of British English include. Billions of people speak English, and there are almost as many pronunciations of it.\\n Rules for speaking and writing vary even within cultures, most notably by region. Do you eat a grinder, a sub, or a hero/gyro? Do you refer to a can of carbonated liquid as “soda” or “pop”? Is a household entertainment room a “family room,” “rec room,” or “den”? When leaving a restaurant, do you ask your server for a “check,” the “ticket,” or your “bill”? Language is constantly evolving and adding new words as societies create new ideas. In this age of technology, many cultures have adapted almost instantly to new nouns such as “e-mail” and “Internet,” and verbs such as “downloading,” “texting,” and “blogging.” These would have been considered nonsense words in the world just twenty-five years ago.\\n Language and Culture\\nEven while it constantly evolves, language shapes our perception of reality and our behavior. In the 1920s, linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf advanced this idea which became known as Sapir-Whorf hypothesis or linguistic relativity. It is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language, and therefore understand their world through the cultural meanings embedded in their language. The hypothesis suggests that language shapes thought and thus behavior (Swoyer, 2003). For example, words have attached meanings beyond their definition that can influence thought and behavior. In the U.S. where the number thirteen is associated with bad luck, many high-rise buildings do not have a 13th floor. In Japan, however, the number four is considered unlucky, since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for “death.”\\n Many sociologists believe that language can have a broad and lasting impact on perception. In 2002, Lera Boroditsky and her colleagues conducted experiments on native German and Spanish speakers in English. Unlike English, these languages assign genders to nouns. In German, for example, the word for sun, die Sonne, is feminine, but the word for moon, der Mond, is masculine.</chunk6>\\n\\n<chunk7>The team chose a set of nouns with opposite genders in German and Spanish and asked participants to provide adjectives to describe them. They found that German speakers used more masculine adjectives than Spanish speakers when describing a noun that was grammatically masculine in German but feminine in Spanish. For example, the word for key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. German speakers described keys as hard, heavy, jagged, metal, serrated, and useful, while Spanish speakers used the adjectives, golden, intricate, little, lovely, shiny, and tiny. The team concluded that gender perceptions acquired in a person’s native language carry forward to how they see the world even when they switch to a language without grammatical genders (Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips, 2002).\\n Some sociologists also believe the structure of language can have consequences on both individual and group behavior. For example, a series of studies have found that Finland has a significantly higher rate of workplace accidents than Sweden despite the fact that the languages have similar workplace regulations (Salminen & Johansson, 2000). John A. Lucy explained this discrepancy through differences in the structure of these languages. Swedish places a greater emphasis on the timing of movement in three-dimensional space. Consequently, Lucy argued, the Swedish factories are physically arranged in a manner that supports the smooth running of the product process. Finnish factors experience frequent disruptions, so that workers must rush and have more accidents (Lucy, 1997).\\n The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has been interpreted to suggest that if a word does not exist in a language then users of that language cannot have the experience. Studies have shown, for instance, that unless people have access to the word “ambivalent,” they don’t recognize having conflicting positive and negative feelings about an issue as ‘ambivalence.’ However, the hypothesis should not suggest that people do not have conflicting feelings but rather that they interpret the feelings differently.\\n In addition to using spoken language, people communicate without words. Nonverbal communication is symbolic, and, as in the case of language, is learned through one’s culture. Some gestures are nearly universal; some are not. Smiles often indicate positive reinforcement in the U.S., whereas in some cultures it is rude as you do not know the person. A thumbs-up in Russia and Australia is an offensive curse (Passero, 2002). Other gestures vary in meaning depending on the situation and the person. A wave of the hand can mean many things, depending on how it’s done and for whom. It may mean “hello,” “goodbye,” “no thank you,” or “I’m royalty.” Winks convey a variety of messages, including “We have a secret,” “I’m only kidding,” or “I’m attracted to you.” From a distance, a person may “read” the emotional situation of people just by watching their body language and facial expressions. However, many cultures communicate with lots of physicality, which people outside that culture may interpret as an argument. So, for example, you might believe two people are arguing when, in fact, they are simply having a regular conversation.\\n</chunk7>\\n\\n<chunk8>SOCIAL POLICY AND DEBATE\\nIs the U.S. Bilingual?\\n When she was six, Lucy and her family immigrated to the United States and attended a school that allowed for the use of both English and Spanish. Lucy’s teacher and many staff were bilingual (fluent in English and Spanish), and the district offered books in both languages. While she was being driven to learn English, the dual-language option helped to ensure that she did not become lost and get behind in her learning of all subjects. Having math, science, and computing taught in both languages helped her understand those concepts and skills. Within two years of enrolling in the school, Lucy was getting nearly all of her instruction in English, and rarely used the Spanish-language books or resources. While she still had trouble with some intricacies of English, her math progress was above grade level and she did well in other subjects as well.\\n Some people might believe that Lucy would have learned faster had she been instructed only in English. But research indicates that is not the case. Johns Hopkins University researchers conducted a series of studies on the effects of bilingual education across multiple subjects (Slavin et al. 2008). They found that students taught in both their native tongue and English make better progress than those taught only in English.\\n Legally, the U.S. has no official language. But many believe English to be the rightful language of the U.S., and over thirty states have passed laws specifying English as their official tongue. Proponents of English-only laws suggest that a national ruling will save money on translation, printing, and human resource costs, including funding for bilingual teachers. They argue that setting English as the official language will encourage non-English speakers to learn English faster and adapt to the culture of the U.S. more easily (Mount 2010). Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) oppose making English the official language and claim that it violates the rights of non-English speakers. English-only laws, they believe, deny the reality of our nation’s diversity and unfairly target non-English speakers. They point to the fact that much of the debate on this topic has risen since 1970, a period during which the U.S. has experienced new waves of immigration from Asia and Mexico.\\n Today, a lot of product information gets written in multiple languages. Enter a store like Home Depot and you’ll find signs in both English and Spanish. Buy a children’s product and the safety warnings could be presented in multiple languages. While marketers are financially motivated to reach the largest number of consumers possible, this trend also may help people become accustomed to a culture of bilingualism.\\n Studies show that most US immigrants eventually abandon their native tongues and become fluent in English. Bilingual education helps with that transition. Today, Lucy is an ambitious and high-achieving college student. Fluent in both English and Spanish, Lucy is studying law enforcement—a field that seeks bilingual employees. The same bilingualism that contributed to her success in grade school will help her thrive professionally as a law officer serving her community.\\n \\n Figure 3.7 Many signs—on streets and in stores—include both English and Spanish. What effect does this have on members of society? What effect does it have on our culture?

Value does not mean monetary worth in sociology, but rather ideals, or principles and standards members of a culture hold in high regard. Most cultures in any society hold “knowledge” (education) in high regard. Values are deeply embedded and are critical for learning a culture’s beliefs, which are the tenets or convictions that people hold to be true. Individual cultures in a society have personal beliefs, but they also shared collective values. To illustrate the difference, U.S. citizens may believe in the American Dream—that anyone who works hard enough will be successful and wealthy. Underlying this belief is the American value that wealth is important. In other cultures, success may be tied less to wealth and more to having many healthy children. Values shape a society by suggesting what is good and bad, beautiful and ugly, sought or avoided.\\n Consider the value that the U.S. places upon youth. Children represent innocence and purity, while a youthful adult appearance signifies sexuality. Shaped by this value, individuals spend millions of dollars each year on cosmetic products and surgeries to look young and beautiful. The U.S. also has an individualistic culture, meaning people place a high value on individuality and independence. In contrast, many other cultures are collectivist, meaning the welfare of the group takes priority over that of the individual. Fulfilling a society’s values can be difficult. Marital monogamy is valued, but many spouses engage in infidelity. Cultural diversity and equal opportunities for all people are valued in the U.S., yet the country’s highest political offices have been dominated by white men.\\n Values often suggest how people should behave, but they don’t accurately reflect how people do behave. Values portray an ideal culture, the standards society would like to embrace and live up to. But ideal culture differs from real culture. In an ideal culture, there would be no traffic accidents, murders, poverty, or racial tension. But in real culture, police officers, lawmakers, educators, and social workers constantly strive to prevent or address these issues. American teenagers are encouraged to value celibacy. However, the number of unplanned pregnancies among teens reveals that the ideal alone is not enough to spare teenagers the potential consequences of having sex.\\n One of the ways societies strive to maintain its values is through rewards and punishments. When people observe the norms of society and uphold its values, they are often rewarded. A boy who helps an elderly woman board a bus may receive a smile and a “thank you.” A business manager who raises profit margins may receive a quarterly bonus. People sanction unwanted or inappropriate behaviors by withholding support, approval, or permission, or by implementing sanctions. We may think of ‘sanction’ as a negative term, but sanctions are forms of social control, ways to encourage conformity to cultural norms or rules.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nNorms can be formal and informal, contextualized with sanctions for non-compliance. Cultural values shift over time and place, and values signify conduct such as public displays of affection varying by culture. Informal norms shape daily actions without written guidelines. Harold Garfinkel's breaching experiments reveal societal adherence to norms through unconventional behavior. These experiments illustrate the dependency on norms within societies. Norms are categorized into mores and folkways, differing in severity and cultural significance. Mores are morally binding, while folkways guide traditional conduct. These undeclared rules make day-to-day life seamless. Symbols, both material and nonmaterial, play a critical role in communication and cultural representation. Their use and interpretation can vary significantly between different cultural contexts. Language—composed of symbols—conveys meaning, shaping perceptions and influencing behavior, as seen in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Variations in language structure, like assigning gender to nouns, can lead to different interpretations and behaviors. Studies suggest language shapes thought and behavior, with structure potentially influencing individual and societal actions. Unspoken, nonverbal communications also play a substantial role in cultural interaction and understanding. Despite no official national language, bilingual education is beneficial in the U.S. context. It aids cultural adaptation and educational progress, countering arguments for English-only laws by emphasizing national diversity and practicality. \\n</contextual_text>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Taken together, these symbols convey specific meanings. The English language uses a combination of twenty-six letters to create words. These twenty-six letters make up over 600,000 recognized words (OED Online, 2011). We can compare the reliance on tone and inflection to Mandarin Chinese. It contains over 8,000 characters, but the same character may symbolize different concepts depending on the tone used.\\n English today contains an English and French version for the same concept. For example, in the English version, one eats, but in French version, one dines. In the English version, we meet someone. In the French version, we encounter someone. Readers of American English may be surprised by the inclusion of a ‘u’ in some spellings of words like ‘behaviour’ or ‘flavour.’ Americans have dropped that ‘u’ that writers of British English include. Billions of people speak English, and there are almost as many pronunciations of it.\\n Rules for speaking and writing vary even within cultures, most notably by region. Do you eat a grinder, a sub, or a hero/gyro? Do you refer to a can of carbonated liquid as “soda” or “pop”? Is a household entertainment room a “family room,” “rec room,” or “den”? When leaving a restaurant, do you ask your server for a “check,” the “ticket,” or your “bill”? Language is constantly evolving and adding new words as societies create new ideas. In this age of technology, many cultures have adapted almost instantly to new nouns such as “e-mail” and “Internet,” and verbs such as “downloading,” “texting,” and “blogging.” These would have been considered nonsense words in the world just twenty-five years ago.\\n Language and Culture\\nEven while it constantly evolves, language shapes our perception of reality and our behavior. In the 1920s, linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf advanced this idea which became known as Sapir-Whorf hypothesis or linguistic relativity. It is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language, and therefore understand their world through the cultural meanings embedded in their language. The hypothesis suggests that language shapes thought and thus behavior (Swoyer, 2003). For example, words have attached meanings beyond their definition that can influence thought and behavior. In the U.S. where the number thirteen is associated with bad luck, many high-rise buildings do not have a 13th floor. In Japan, however, the number four is considered unlucky, since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for “death.”\\n Many sociologists believe that language can have a broad and lasting impact on perception. In 2002, Lera Boroditsky and her colleagues conducted experiments on native German and Spanish speakers in English. Unlike English, these languages assign genders to nouns. In German, for example, the word for sun, die Sonne, is feminine, but the word for moon, der Mond, is masculine.\\nThe team chose a set of nouns with opposite genders in German and Spanish and asked participants to provide adjectives to describe them. They found that German speakers used more masculine adjectives than Spanish speakers when describing a noun that was grammatically masculine in German but feminine in Spanish. For example, the word for key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. German speakers described keys as hard, heavy, jagged, metal, serrated, and useful, while Spanish speakers used the adjectives, golden, intricate, little, lovely, shiny, and tiny. The team concluded that gender perceptions acquired in a person’s native language carry forward to how they see the world even when they switch to a language without grammatical genders (Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips, 2002).\\n Some sociologists also believe the structure of language can have consequences on both individual and group behavior. For example, a series of studies have found that Finland has a significantly higher rate of workplace accidents than Sweden despite the fact that the languages have similar workplace regulations (Salminen & Johansson, 2000). John A. Lucy explained this discrepancy through differences in the structure of these languages. Swedish places a greater emphasis on the timing of movement in three-dimensional space. Consequently, Lucy argued, the Swedish factories are physically arranged in a manner that supports the smooth running of the product process. Finnish factors experience frequent disruptions, so that workers must rush and have more accidents (Lucy, 1997).\\n The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has been interpreted to suggest that if a word does not exist in a language then users of that language cannot have the experience. Studies have shown, for instance, that unless people have access to the word “ambivalent,” they don’t recognize having conflicting positive and negative feelings about an issue as ‘ambivalence.’ However, the hypothesis should not suggest that people do not have conflicting feelings but rather that they interpret the feelings differently.\\n In addition to using spoken language, people communicate without words. Nonverbal communication is symbolic, and, as in the case of language, is learned through one’s culture. Some gestures are nearly universal; some are not. Smiles often indicate positive reinforcement in the U.S., whereas in some cultures it is rude as you do not know the person. A thumbs-up in Russia and Australia is an offensive curse (Passero, 2002). Other gestures vary in meaning depending on the situation and the person. A wave of the hand can mean many things, depending on how it’s done and for whom. It may mean “hello,” “goodbye,” “no thank you,” or “I’m royalty.” Winks convey a variety of messages, including “We have a secret,” “I’m only kidding,” or “I’m attracted to you.” From a distance, a person may “read” the emotional situation of people just by watching their body language and facial expressions. However, many cultures communicate with lots of physicality, which people outside that culture may interpret as an argument. So, for example, you might believe two people are arguing when, in fact, they are simply having a regular conversation.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nThis section outlines the fundamental elements of culture including values, beliefs, norms, the significance of symbols, and social control.

Value does not mean monetary worth in sociology, but rather ideals, or principles and standards members of a culture hold in high regard. Most cultures in any society hold “knowledge” (education) in high regard. Values are deeply embedded and are critical for learning a culture’s beliefs, which are the tenets or convictions that people hold to be true. Individual cultures in a society have personal beliefs, but they also shared collective values. To illustrate the difference, U.S. citizens may believe in the American Dream—that anyone who works hard enough will be successful and wealthy. Underlying this belief is the American value that wealth is important. In other cultures, success may be tied less to wealth and more to having many healthy children. Values shape a society by suggesting what is good and bad, beautiful and ugly, sought or avoided.\\n Consider the value that the U.S. places upon youth. Children represent innocence and purity, while a youthful adult appearance signifies sexuality. Shaped by this value, individuals spend millions of dollars each year on cosmetic products and surgeries to look young and beautiful. The U.S. also has an individualistic culture, meaning people place a high value on individuality and independence. In contrast, many other cultures are collectivist, meaning the welfare of the group takes priority over that of the individual. Fulfilling a society’s values can be difficult. Marital monogamy is valued, but many spouses engage in infidelity. Cultural diversity and equal opportunities for all people are valued in the U.S., yet the country’s highest political offices have been dominated by white men.\\n Values often suggest how people should behave, but they don’t accurately reflect how people do behave. Values portray an ideal culture, the standards society would like to embrace and live up to. But ideal culture differs from real culture. In an ideal culture, there would be no traffic accidents, murders, poverty, or racial tension. But in real culture, police officers, lawmakers, educators, and social workers constantly strive to prevent or address these issues. American teenagers are encouraged to value celibacy. However, the number of unplanned pregnancies among teens reveals that the ideal alone is not enough to spare teenagers the potential consequences of having sex.\\n One of the ways societies strive to maintain its values is through rewards and punishments. When people observe the norms of society and uphold its values, they are often rewarded. A boy who helps an elderly woman board a bus may receive a smile and a “thank you.” A business manager who raises profit margins may receive a quarterly bonus. People sanction unwanted or inappropriate behaviors by withholding support, approval, or permission, or by implementing sanctions. We may think of ‘sanction’ as a negative term, but sanctions are forms of social control, ways to encourage conformity to cultural norms or rules.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\nNorms can be formal and informal, contextualized with sanctions for non-compliance. Cultural values shift over time and place, and values signify conduct such as public displays of affection varying by culture. Informal norms shape daily actions without written guidelines. Harold Garfinkel's breaching experiments reveal societal adherence to norms through unconventional behavior. These experiments illustrate the dependency on norms within societies. Norms are categorized into mores and folkways, differing in severity and cultural significance. Mores are morally binding, while folkways guide traditional conduct. These undeclared rules make day-to-day life seamless. Symbols, both material and nonmaterial, play a critical role in communication and cultural representation. Their use and interpretation can vary significantly between different cultural contexts. Language—composed of symbols—conveys meaning, shaping perceptions and influencing behavior, as seen in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Variations in language structure, like assigning gender to nouns, can lead to different interpretations and behaviors. Studies suggest language shapes thought and behavior, with structure potentially influencing individual and societal actions. Unspoken, nonverbal communications also play a substantial role in cultural interaction and understanding. Despite no official national language, bilingual education is beneficial in the U.S. context. It aids cultural adaptation and educational progress, countering arguments for English-only laws by emphasizing national diversity and practicality. \\n</contextual_text>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Taken together, these symbols convey specific meanings. The English language uses a combination of twenty-six letters to create words. These twenty-six letters make up over 600,000 recognized words (OED Online, 2011). We can compare the reliance on tone and inflection to Mandarin Chinese. It contains over 8,000 characters, but the same character may symbolize different concepts depending on the tone used.\\n English today contains an English and French version for the same concept. For example, in the English version, one eats, but in French version, one dines. In the English version, we meet someone. In the French version, we encounter someone. Readers of American English may be surprised by the inclusion of a ‘u’ in some spellings of words like ‘behaviour’ or ‘flavour.’ Americans have dropped that ‘u’ that writers of British English include. Billions of people speak English, and there are almost as many pronunciations of it.\\n Rules for speaking and writing vary even within cultures, most notably by region. Do you eat a grinder, a sub, or a hero/gyro? Do you refer to a can of carbonated liquid as “soda” or “pop”? Is a household entertainment room a “family room,” “rec room,” or “den”? When leaving a restaurant, do you ask your server for a “check,” the “ticket,” or your “bill”? Language is constantly evolving and adding new words as societies create new ideas. In this age of technology, many cultures have adapted almost instantly to new nouns such as “e-mail” and “Internet,” and verbs such as “downloading,” “texting,” and “blogging.” These would have been considered nonsense words in the world just twenty-five years ago.\\n Language and Culture\\nEven while it constantly evolves, language shapes our perception of reality and our behavior. In the 1920s, linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf advanced this idea which became known as Sapir-Whorf hypothesis or linguistic relativity. It is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language, and therefore understand their world through the cultural meanings embedded in their language. The hypothesis suggests that language shapes thought and thus behavior (Swoyer, 2003). For example, words have attached meanings beyond their definition that can influence thought and behavior. In the U.S. where the number thirteen is associated with bad luck, many high-rise buildings do not have a 13th floor. In Japan, however, the number four is considered unlucky, since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for “death.”\\n Many sociologists believe that language can have a broad and lasting impact on perception. In 2002, Lera Boroditsky and her colleagues conducted experiments on native German and Spanish speakers in English. Unlike English, these languages assign genders to nouns. In German, for example, the word for sun, die Sonne, is feminine, but the word for moon, der Mond, is masculine.\\nThe team chose a set of nouns with opposite genders in German and Spanish and asked participants to provide adjectives to describe them. They found that German speakers used more masculine adjectives than Spanish speakers when describing a noun that was grammatically masculine in German but feminine in Spanish. For example, the word for key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. German speakers described keys as hard, heavy, jagged, metal, serrated, and useful, while Spanish speakers used the adjectives, golden, intricate, little, lovely, shiny, and tiny. The team concluded that gender perceptions acquired in a person’s native language carry forward to how they see the world even when they switch to a language without grammatical genders (Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips, 2002).\\n Some sociologists also believe the structure of language can have consequences on both individual and group behavior. For example, a series of studies have found that Finland has a significantly higher rate of workplace accidents than Sweden despite the fact that the languages have similar workplace regulations (Salminen & Johansson, 2000). John A. Lucy explained this discrepancy through differences in the structure of these languages. Swedish places a greater emphasis on the timing of movement in three-dimensional space. Consequently, Lucy argued, the Swedish factories are physically arranged in a manner that supports the smooth running of the product process. Finnish factors experience frequent disruptions, so that workers must rush and have more accidents (Lucy, 1997).\\n The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has been interpreted to suggest that if a word does not exist in a language then users of that language cannot have the experience. Studies have shown, for instance, that unless people have access to the word “ambivalent,” they don’t recognize having conflicting positive and negative feelings about an issue as ‘ambivalence.’ However, the hypothesis should not suggest that people do not have conflicting feelings but rather that they interpret the feelings differently.\\n In addition to using spoken language, people communicate without words. Nonverbal communication is symbolic, and, as in the case of language, is learned through one’s culture. Some gestures are nearly universal; some are not. Smiles often indicate positive reinforcement in the U.S., whereas in some cultures it is rude as you do not know the person. A thumbs-up in Russia and Australia is an offensive curse (Passero, 2002). Other gestures vary in meaning depending on the situation and the person. A wave of the hand can mean many things, depending on how it’s done and for whom. It may mean “hello,” “goodbye,” “no thank you,” or “I’m royalty.” Winks convey a variety of messages, including “We have a secret,” “I’m only kidding,” or “I’m attracted to you.” From a distance, a person may “read” the emotional situation of people just by watching their body language and facial expressions. However, many cultures communicate with lots of physicality, which people outside that culture may interpret as an argument. So, for example, you might believe two people are arguing when, in fact, they are simply having a regular conversation.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\nThis section outlines the fundamental elements of culture including values, beliefs, norms, the significance of symbols, and social control. Values and beliefs drive societal standards and personal convictions, while norms dictate expected behaviors. Social control is maintained through rewards and punishments. Norms can be formal and informal, contextualized with sanctions for non-compliance. Cultural values shift over time and place, and values signify conduct such as public displays of affection varying by culture. Informal norms shape daily actions without written guidelines. Harold Garfinkel's breaching experiments reveal societal adherence to norms through unconventional behavior. These experiments illustrate the dependency on norms within societies. Norms are categorized into mores and folkways, differing in severity and cultural significance. Mores are morally binding, while folkways guide traditional conduct. These undeclared rules make day-to-day life seamless. Symbols, both material and nonmaterial, play a critical role in communication and cultural representation. Their use and interpretation can vary significantly between different cultural contexts. Despite no official national language, bilingual education is beneficial in the U.S. context. It aids cultural adaptation and educational progress, countering arguments for English-only laws by emphasizing national diversity and practicality. \\n</contextual_text>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

Value does not mean monetary worth in sociology, but rather ideals, or principles and standards members of a culture hold in high regard. Most cultures in any society hold “knowledge” (education) in high regard. Values are deeply embedded and are critical for learning a culture’s beliefs, which are the tenets or convictions that people hold to be true. Individual cultures in a society have personal beliefs, but they also shared collective values. To illustrate the difference, U.S. citizens may believe in the American Dream—that anyone who works hard enough will be successful and wealthy. Underlying this belief is the American value that wealth is important. In other cultures, success may be tied less to wealth and more to having many healthy children. Values shape a society by suggesting what is good and bad, beautiful and ugly, sought or avoided.\\n Consider the value that the U.S. places upon youth. Children represent innocence and purity, while a youthful adult appearance signifies sexuality. Shaped by this value, individuals spend millions of dollars each year on cosmetic products and surgeries to look young and beautiful. The U.S. also has an individualistic culture, meaning people place a high value on individuality and independence. In contrast, many other cultures are collectivist, meaning the welfare of the group takes priority over that of the individual. Fulfilling a society’s values can be difficult. Marital monogamy is valued, but many spouses engage in infidelity. Cultural diversity and equal opportunities for all people are valued in the U.S., yet the country’s highest political offices have been dominated by white men.\\n Values often suggest how people should behave, but they don’t accurately reflect how people do behave. Values portray an ideal culture, the standards society would like to embrace and live up to. But ideal culture differs from real culture. In an ideal culture, there would be no traffic accidents, murders, poverty, or racial tension. But in real culture, police officers, lawmakers, educators, and social workers constantly strive to prevent or address these issues. American teenagers are encouraged to value celibacy. However, the number of unplanned pregnancies among teens reveals that the ideal alone is not enough to spare teenagers the potential consequences of having sex.\\n One of the ways societies strive to maintain its values is through rewards and punishments. When people observe the norms of society and uphold its values, they are often rewarded. A boy who helps an elderly woman board a bus may receive a smile and a “thank you.” A business manager who raises profit margins may receive a quarterly bonus. People sanction unwanted or inappropriate behaviors by withholding support, approval, or permission, or by implementing sanctions. We may think of ‘sanction’ as a negative term, but sanctions are forms of social control, ways to encourage conformity to cultural norms or rules.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nNorms can be formal and informal, contextualized with sanctions for non-compliance. Cultural values shift over time and place, and values signify conduct such as public displays of affection varying by culture. Informal norms shape daily actions without written guidelines. Harold Garfinkel's breaching experiments reveal societal adherence to norms through unconventional behavior. These experiments illustrate the dependency on norms within societies. Norms are categorized into mores and folkways, differing in severity and cultural significance. Mores are morally binding, while folkways guide traditional conduct. These undeclared rules make day-to-day life seamless. Symbols, both material and nonmaterial, play a critical role in communication and cultural representation. Their use and interpretation can vary significantly between different cultural contexts. Language—composed of symbols—conveys meaning, shaping perceptions and influencing behavior, as seen in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Variations in language structure, like assigning gender to nouns, can lead to different interpretations and behaviors. Studies suggest language shapes thought and behavior, with structure potentially influencing individual and societal actions. Unspoken, nonverbal communications also play a substantial role in cultural interaction and understanding. Despite no official national language, bilingual education is beneficial in the U.S. context. It aids cultural adaptation and educational progress, countering arguments for English-only laws by emphasizing national diversity and practicality. \\n</contextual_text>\", 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'completion': '**Reasoning:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Formulate the Question:**\\n\\nThe question needs to target the factual information about the role of values in culture, particularly how they define ideals and principles.

Taken together, these symbols convey specific meanings. The English language uses a combination of twenty-six letters to create words. These twenty-six letters make up over 600,000 recognized words (OED Online, 2011). We can compare the reliance on tone and inflection to Mandarin Chinese. It contains over 8,000 characters, but the same character may symbolize different concepts depending on the tone used.\\n English today contains an English and French version for the same concept. For example, in the English version, one eats, but in French version, one dines. In the English version, we meet someone. In the French version, we encounter someone. Readers of American English may be surprised by the inclusion of a ‘u’ in some spellings of words like ‘behaviour’ or ‘flavour.’ Americans have dropped that ‘u’ that writers of British English include. Billions of people speak English, and there are almost as many pronunciations of it.\\n Rules for speaking and writing vary even within cultures, most notably by region. Do you eat a grinder, a sub, or a hero/gyro? Do you refer to a can of carbonated liquid as “soda” or “pop”? Is a household entertainment room a “family room,” “rec room,” or “den”? When leaving a restaurant, do you ask your server for a “check,” the “ticket,” or your “bill”? Language is constantly evolving and adding new words as societies create new ideas. In this age of technology, many cultures have adapted almost instantly to new nouns such as “e-mail” and “Internet,” and verbs such as “downloading,” “texting,” and “blogging.” These would have been considered nonsense words in the world just twenty-five years ago.\\n Language and Culture\\nEven while it constantly evolves, language shapes our perception of reality and our behavior. In the 1920s, linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf advanced this idea which became known as Sapir-Whorf hypothesis or linguistic relativity. It is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language, and therefore understand their world through the cultural meanings embedded in their language. The hypothesis suggests that language shapes thought and thus behavior (Swoyer, 2003). For example, words have attached meanings beyond their definition that can influence thought and behavior. In the U.S. where the number thirteen is associated with bad luck, many high-rise buildings do not have a 13th floor. In Japan, however, the number four is considered unlucky, since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for “death.”\\n Many sociologists believe that language can have a broad and lasting impact on perception. In 2002, Lera Boroditsky and her colleagues conducted experiments on native German and Spanish speakers in English. Unlike English, these languages assign genders to nouns. In German, for example, the word for sun, die Sonne, is feminine, but the word for moon, der Mond, is masculine.\\nThe team chose a set of nouns with opposite genders in German and Spanish and asked participants to provide adjectives to describe them. They found that German speakers used more masculine adjectives than Spanish speakers when describing a noun that was grammatically masculine in German but feminine in Spanish. For example, the word for key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. German speakers described keys as hard, heavy, jagged, metal, serrated, and useful, while Spanish speakers used the adjectives, golden, intricate, little, lovely, shiny, and tiny. The team concluded that gender perceptions acquired in a person’s native language carry forward to how they see the world even when they switch to a language without grammatical genders (Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips, 2002).\\n Some sociologists also believe the structure of language can have consequences on both individual and group behavior. For example, a series of studies have found that Finland has a significantly higher rate of workplace accidents than Sweden despite the fact that the languages have similar workplace regulations (Salminen & Johansson, 2000). John A. Lucy explained this discrepancy through differences in the structure of these languages. Swedish places a greater emphasis on the timing of movement in three-dimensional space. Consequently, Lucy argued, the Swedish factories are physically arranged in a manner that supports the smooth running of the product process. Finnish factors experience frequent disruptions, so that workers must rush and have more accidents (Lucy, 1997).\\n The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has been interpreted to suggest that if a word does not exist in a language then users of that language cannot have the experience. Studies have shown, for instance, that unless people have access to the word “ambivalent,” they don’t recognize having conflicting positive and negative feelings about an issue as ‘ambivalence.’ However, the hypothesis should not suggest that people do not have conflicting feelings but rather that they interpret the feelings differently.\\n In addition to using spoken language, people communicate without words. Nonverbal communication is symbolic, and, as in the case of language, is learned through one’s culture. Some gestures are nearly universal; some are not. Smiles often indicate positive reinforcement in the U.S., whereas in some cultures it is rude as you do not know the person. A thumbs-up in Russia and Australia is an offensive curse (Passero, 2002). Other gestures vary in meaning depending on the situation and the person. A wave of the hand can mean many things, depending on how it’s done and for whom. It may mean “hello,” “goodbye,” “no thank you,” or “I’m royalty.” Winks convey a variety of messages, including “We have a secret,” “I’m only kidding,” or “I’m attracted to you.” From a distance, a person may “read” the emotional situation of people just by watching their body language and facial expressions. However, many cultures communicate with lots of physicality, which people outside that culture may interpret as an argument. So, for example, you might believe two people are arguing when, in fact, they are simply having a regular conversation.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nThis section outlines the fundamental elements of culture including values, beliefs, norms, the significance of symbols, and social control. Values and beliefs drive societal standards and personal convictions, while norms dictate expected behaviors. Social control is maintained through rewards and punishments. Norms can be formal and informal, contextualized with sanctions for non-compliance. Cultural values shift over time and place, and values signify conduct such as public displays of affection varying by culture. Informal norms shape daily actions without written guidelines.

Values and beliefs drive societal standards and personal convictions, while norms dictate expected behaviors. Social control is maintained through rewards and punishments.  Norms can be formal and informal, contextualized with sanctions for non-compliance. Cultural values shift over time and place, and values signify conduct such as public displays of affection varying by culture.  Informal norms shape daily actions without written guidelines. Harold Garfinkel's breaching experiments reveal societal adherence to norms through unconventional behavior. These experiments illustrate the dependency on norms within societies.  Norms are categorized into mores and folkways, differing in severity and cultural significance. Mores are morally binding, while folkways guide traditional conduct. These undeclared rules make day-to-day life seamless.  Symbols, both material and nonmaterial, play a critical role in communication and cultural representation. Their use and interpretation can vary significantly between different cultural contexts.  Language—composed of symbols—conveys meaning, shaping perceptions and influencing behavior, as seen in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Variations in language structure, like assigning gender to nouns, can lead to different interpretations and behaviors.  Studies suggest language shapes thought and behavior, with structure potentially influencing individual and societal actions. Unspoken, nonverbal communications also play a substantial role in cultural interaction and understanding.  Despite no official national language, bilingual education is beneficial in the U.S. context.

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Learning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you should be able to:\\n•\\tRecall the 6 Steps of the Scientific Method\\n•\\tDifferentiate between four kinds of research methods: surveys, field research, experiments, and secondary data analysis.\\n •\\tExplain the appropriateness of specific research approaches for specific topics.\\n Sociologists examine the social world, see a problem or interesting pattern, and set out to study it. They use research methods to design a study. Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study. Sociologists generally choose from widely used methods of social investigation: primary source data collection such as survey, participant observation, ethnography, case study, unobtrusive observations, experiment, and secondary data analysis, or use of existing sources. Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use. When you are conducting research think about the best way to gather or obtain knowledge about your topic, think of yourself as an architect. An architect needs a blueprint to build a house, as a sociologist your blueprint is your research design including your data collection method.\\n When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being observed. A researcher wouldn’t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, “Any gang members around?”\\n Making sociologists’ presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers can’t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe behaviors or attract attention. In situations like these, other methods are needed. Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics, protect research participants or subjects, and that fit with their overall approaches to research.\\n Surveys\\nAs a research method, a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire or an interview. The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in which they can express personal ideas.\\n Figure 2.3 Questionnaires are a common research method. (Credit: CDC Global/flickr)\\n At some point, most people in the United States respond to some type of survey. The 2020 U.S. Census is an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Since 1790, United States has conducted a survey consisting of six questions to received demographical data pertaining to residents. The questions pertain to the demographics of the residents who live in the United States. Currently, the Census is received by residents in the United Stated and five territories and consists of 12 questions.\\n Not all surveys are considered sociological research, however, and many surveys people commonly encounter focus on identifying marketing needs and strategies rather than testing a hypothesis or contributing to social science knowledge.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>Questions such as, “How many hot dogs do you eat in a month?” or “Were the staff helpful?” are not usually designed as scientific research. The Nielsen Ratings determine the popularity of television programming through scientific market research. However, polls conducted by television programs such as American Idol or So You Think You Can Dance cannot be generalized, because they are administered to an unrepresentative population, a specific show’s audience. You might receive polls through your cell phones or emails, from grocery stores, restaurants, and retail stores. They often provide you incentives for completing the survey.\\n Figure 2.4 Real-time surveys are common in classrooms, live-audience events, and even popular media. Twitter polls have often replaced physical devices such as the one pictured. (Credit: Sam Howzit/flickr)\\nSociologists conduct surveys under controlled conditions for specific purposes. Surveys gather different types of information from people. While surveys are not great at capturing the ways people really behave in social situations, they are a great method for discovering how people feel, think, and act—or at least how they say they feel, think, and act. Surveys can track preferences for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors (such as sleeping, driving, or texting habits) or information such as employment status, income, and education levels.\\n A survey targets a specific population, people who are the focus of a study, such as college athletes, international students, or teenagers living with type 1 (juvenile-onset) diabetes. Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population, or a sample, a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population. The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample. In a random sample, every person in a population has the same chance of being chosen for the study. As a result, a Gallup Poll, if conducted as a nationwide random sampling, should be able to provide an accurate estimate of public opinion whether it contacts 2,000 or 10,000 people.\\n After selecting subjects, the researcher develops a specific plan to ask questions and record responses. It is important to inform subjects of the nature and purpose of the survey up front. If they agree to participate, researchers thank subjects and offer them a chance to see the results of the study if they are interested. The researcher presents the subjects with an instrument, which is a means of gathering the information.\\n A common instrument is a questionnaire. Subjects often answer a series of closed-ended questions. The researcher might ask yes-or-no or multiple-choice questions, allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question. This kind of questionnaire collects quantitative data—data in numerical form that can be counted and statistically analyzed. Just count up the number of “yes” and “no” responses or correct answers, and chart them into percentages.\\n Questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers—beyond “yes,” “no,” or checkbox options. These types of inquiries use open-ended questions that require short essay responses.</chunk2>\\n\\n<chunk3>Participants willing to take the time to write those answers might convey personal religious beliefs, political views, goals, or morals. The answers are subjective and vary from person to person. How do you plan to use your college education?\\n Some topics that investigate internal thought processes are impossible to observe directly and are difficult to discuss honestly in a public forum. People are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously. This type of personal explanation is qualitative data—conveyed through words. Qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate. The researcher will end up with a wide range of responses, some of which may be surprising. The benefit of written opinions, though, is the wealth of in-depth material that they provide.\\n An interview is a one-on-one conversation between the researcher and the subject, and it is a way of conducting surveys on a topic. However, participants are free to respond as they wish, without being limited by predetermined choices. In the back-and-forth conversation of an interview, a researcher can ask for clarification, spend more time on a subtopic, or ask additional questions. In an interview, a subject will ideally feel free to open up and answer questions that are often complex. There are no right or wrong answers. The subject might not even know how to answer the questions honestly.\\n Questions such as “How does society’s view of alcohol consumption influence your decision whether or not to take your first sip of alcohol?” or “Did you feel that the divorce of your parents would put a social stigma on your family?” involve so many factors that the answers are difficult to categorize. A researcher needs to avoid steering or prompting the subject to respond in a specific way; otherwise, the results will prove to be unreliable. The researcher will also benefit from gaining a subject’s trust, from empathizing or commiserating with a subject, and from listening without judgment.\\n Surveys often collect both quantitative and qualitative data. For example, a researcher interviewing people who are incarcerated might receive quantitative data, such as demographics – race, age, sex, that can be analyzed statistically. For example, the researcher might discover that 20 percent of incarcerated people are above the age of 50. The researcher might also collect qualitative data, such as why people take advantage of educational opportunities during their sentence and other explanatory information.\\n The survey can be carried out online, over the phone, by mail, or face-to-face. When researchers collect data outside a laboratory, library, or workplace setting, they are conducting field research, which is our next topic.\\n Field Research\\nThe work of sociology rarely happens in limited, confined spaces. Rather, sociologists go out into the world. They meet subjects where they live, work, and play. Field research refers to gathering primary data from a natural environment. To conduct field research, the sociologist must be willing to step into new environments and observe, participate, or experience those worlds. In field work, the sociologists, rather than the subjects, are the ones out of their element.\\n</chunk3>\\n\\n<chunk4>The researcher interacts with or observes people and gathers data along the way. The key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject’s natural environment, whether it’s a coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.\\n Figure 2.5 Sociological researchers travel across countries and cultures to interact with and observe subjects in their natural environments. (Credit: IMLS Digital Collections and Content/flickr)\\n While field research often begins in a specific setting, the study’s purpose is to observe specific behaviors in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing how people think and behave. It seeks to understand why they behave that way. However, researchers may struggle to narrow down cause and effect when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment. And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables. Indeed, much of the data gathered in sociology do not identify a cause and effect but a correlation.\\n Figure 2.6 Researchers have used surveys and participant observations to accumulate data on Lady Gaga and Beyonce as multifaceted performers. (Credit a: John Robert Chartlon/flickr, b: Kristopher Harris/flickr.)\\n Sociologists have studied Lady Gaga and Beyoncé and their impact on music, movies, social media, fan participation, and social equality. In their studies, researchers have used several research methods including secondary analysis, participant observation, and surveys from concert participants.\\n In their study, Click, Lee & Holiday (2013) interviewed 45 Lady Gaga fans who utilized social media to communicate with the artist. These fans viewed Lady Gaga as a mirror of themselves and a source of inspiration. Like her, they embrace not being a part of mainstream culture. Many of Lady Gaga’s fans are members of the LGBTQ community. They see the “song “Born This Way” as a rallying cry and answer her calls for “Paws Up” with a physical expression of solidarity—outstretched arms and ﬁngers bent and curled to resemble monster claws.”\\n Sascha Buchanan (2019) made use of participant observation to study the relationship between two fan groups, that of Beyoncé and that of Rihanna. She observed award shows sponsored by iHeartRadio, MTV EMA, and BET that pit one group against another as they competed for Best Fan Army, Biggest Fans, and FANdemonium. Buchanan argues that the media thus sustains a myth of rivalry between the two most commercially successful Black women vocal artists.</chunk4>\\n\\n<chunk5>\\nParticipant Observation\\nIn 2000, a comic writer named Rodney Rothman wanted an insider’s view of white-collar work. He slipped into the sterile, high-rise offices of a New York “dot com” agency. Every day for two weeks, he pretended to work there. His main purpose was simply to see whether anyone would notice him or challenge his presence. No one did. The receptionist greeted him. The employees smiled and said good morning. Rothman was accepted as part of the team. He even went so far as to claim a desk, inform the receptionist of his whereabouts, and attend a meeting. He published an article about his experience in The New Yorker called “My Fake Job” (2000). Later, he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology. However, Rothman’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “dot com” company and exemplified the lengths to which a writer, or a sociologist, will go to uncover material.\\n Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation, in which researchers join people and participate in a group’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context. This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life. A researcher might go to great lengths to get a firsthand look into a trend, institution, or behavior. A researcher might work as a waitress in a diner, experience homelessness for several weeks, or ride along with police officers as they patrol their regular beat. Often, these researchers try to blend in seamlessly with the population they study, and they may not disclose their true identity or purpose if they feel it would compromise the results of their research.\\n Figure 2.7 Is she a working waitress or a sociologist conducting a study using participant observation? A field researcher may take a job or take other steps to get firsthand knowledge of their subjects. (Credit: Gareth Williams/flickr.)\\n At the beginning of a field study, researchers might have a question: “What really goes on in the kitchen of the most popular diner on campus?” or “What is it like to be homeless?” Participant observation is a useful method if the researcher wants to explore a certain environment from the inside.\\n Field researchers simply want to observe and learn. In such a setting, the researcher will be alert and open minded to whatever happens, recording all observations accurately. Soon, as patterns emerge, questions will become more specific, observations will lead to hypotheses, and hypotheses will guide the researcher in analyzing data and generating results.\\n In a study of small towns in the United States conducted by sociological researchers John S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd, the team altered their purpose as they gathered data. They initially planned to focus their study on the role of religion in U.S. towns. As they gathered observations, they realized that the effect of industrialization and urbanization was the more relevant topic of this social group. The Lynds did not change their methods, but they revised the purpose of their study.\\n</chunk5>\\n\\n<chunk6>This shaped the structure of Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture, their published results (Lynd & Lynd, 1929).\\n The Lynds were upfront about their mission. The townspeople of Muncie, Indiana, knew why the researchers were in their midst. But some sociologists prefer not to alert people to their presence. The main advantage of covert participant observation is that it allows the researcher access to authentic, natural behaviors of a group’s members. The challenge, however, is gaining access to a setting without disrupting the pattern of others’ behavior. Becoming an inside member of a group, organization, or subculture takes time and effort. Researchers must pretend to be something they are not. The process could involve role playing, making contacts, networking, or applying for a job.\\n Once inside a group, some researchers spend months or even years pretending to be one of the people they are observing. However, as observers, they cannot get too involved. They must keep their purpose in mind and apply the sociological perspective. That way, they illuminate social patterns that are often unrecognized. Because information gathered during participant observation is mostly qualitative, rather than quantitative, the end results are often descriptive or interpretive. The researcher might present findings in an article or book and describe what he or she witnessed and experienced.\\n This type of research is what journalist Barbara Ehrenreich conducted for her book Nickel and Dimed. One day over lunch with her editor, Ehrenreich mentioned an idea. How can people exist on minimum-wage work? How do low-income workers get by? she wondered. Someone should do a study. To her surprise, her editor responded, Why don’t you do it?\\n That’s how Ehrenreich found herself joining the ranks of the working class. For several months, she left her comfortable home and lived and worked among people who lacked, for the most part, higher education and marketable job skills. Undercover, she applied for and worked minimum wage jobs as a waitress, a cleaning woman, a nursing home aide, and a retail chain employee. During her participant observation, she used only her income from those jobs to pay for food, clothing, transportation, and shelter.\\n She discovered the obvious, that it’s almost impossible to get by on minimum wage work. She also experienced and observed attitudes many middle and upper-class people never think about. She witnessed firsthand the treatment of working class employees. She saw the extreme measures people take to make ends meet and to survive. She described fellow employees who held two or three jobs, worked seven days a week, lived in cars, could not pay to treat chronic health conditions, got randomly fired, submitted to drug tests, and moved in and out of homeless shelters. She brought aspects of that life to light, describing difficult working conditions and the poor treatment that low-wage workers suffer.\\n The book she wrote upon her return to her real life as a well-paid writer, has been widely read and used in many college classrooms.\\n Figure 2.8 Field research happens in real locations.</chunk6>\\n\\n<chunk7>What type of environment do work spaces foster? What would a sociologist discover after blending in? (Credit: Lyncconf Games/flickr)\\n Ethnography\\nEthnography is the immersion of the researcher in the natural setting of an entire social community to observe and experience their everyday life and culture. The heart of an ethnographic study focuses on how subjects view their own social standing and how they understand themselves in relation to a social group.\\n An ethnographic study might observe, for example, a small U.S. fishing town, an Inuit community, a village in Thailand, a Buddhist monastery, a private boarding school, or an amusement park. These places all have borders. People live, work, study, or vacation within those borders. People are there for a certain reason and therefore behave in certain ways and respect certain cultural norms. An ethnographer would commit to spending a determined amount of time studying every aspect of the chosen place, taking in as much as possible.\\n A sociologist studying a tribe in the Amazon might watch the way villagers go about their daily lives and then write a paper about it. To observe a spiritual retreat center, an ethnographer might sign up for a retreat and attend as a guest for an extended stay, observe and record data, and collate the material into results.\\n Institutional Ethnography\\nInstitutional ethnography is an extension of basic ethnographic research principles that focuses intentionally on everyday concrete social relationships. Developed by Canadian sociologist Dorothy E. Smith (1990), institutional ethnography is often considered a feminist-inspired approach to social analysis and primarily considers women’s experiences within male- dominated societies and power structures. Smith’s work is seen to challenge sociology’s exclusion of women, both academically and in the study of women’s lives (Fenstermaker, n.d.).\\n Historically, social science research tended to objectify women and ignore their experiences except as viewed from the male perspective. Modern feminists note that describing women, and other marginalized groups, as subordinates helps those in authority maintain their own dominant positions (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada n.d.). Smith’s three major works explored what she called “the conceptual practices of power” and are still considered seminal works in feminist theory and ethnography (Fensternmaker n.d.).\\n SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH\\nThe Making of Middletown: A Study in Modern U.S. Culture\\nIn 1924, a young married couple named Robert and Helen Lynd undertook an unprecedented ethnography: to apply sociological methods to the study of one U.S. city in order to discover what “ordinary” people in the United States did and believed. Choosing Muncie, Indiana (population about 30,000) as their subject, they moved to the small town and lived there for eighteen months.\\n Ethnographers had been examining other cultures for decades—groups considered minorities or outsiders—like gangs, immigrants, and the poor. But no one had studied the so-called average American.\\n Recording interviews and using surveys to gather data, the Lynds objectively described what they observed. Researching existing sources, they compared Muncie in 1890 to the Muncie they observed in 1924. Most Muncie adults, they found, had grown up on farms but now lived in homes inside the city.</chunk7>\\n\\n<chunk8>As a result, the Lynds focused their study on the impact of industrialization and urbanization.\\n They observed that Muncie was divided into business and working class groups. They defined business class as dealing with abstract concepts and symbols, while working class people used tools to create concrete objects. The two classes led different lives with different goals and hopes. However, the Lynds observed, mass production offered both classes the same amenities. Like wealthy families, the working class was now able to own radios, cars, washing machines, telephones, vacuum cleaners, and refrigerators. This was an emerging material reality of the 1920s.\\n As the Lynds worked, they divided their manuscript into six chapters: Getting a Living, Making a Home, Training the Young, Using Leisure, Engaging in Religious Practices, and Engaging in Community Activities.\\n When the study was completed, the Lynds encountered a big problem. The Rockefeller Foundation, which had commissioned the book, claimed it was useless and refused to publish it. The Lynds asked if they could seek a publisher themselves.\\n Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture was not only published in 1929 but also became an instant bestseller, a status unheard of for a sociological study. The book sold out six printings in its first year of publication, and has never gone out of print (Caplow, Hicks, & Wattenberg. 2000).\\n Nothing like it had ever been done before. Middletown was reviewed on the front page of the New York Times. Readers in the 1920s and 1930s identified with the citizens of Muncie, Indiana, but they were equally fascinated by the sociological methods and the use of scientific data to define ordinary people in the United States. The book was proof that social data was important—and interesting—to the U.S.\\nFigure 2.9 A classroom in Muncie, Indiana, in 1917, five years before John and Helen Lynd began researching this “typical” U.S. community. (Credit: Don O’Brien/flickr)\\n Case Study\\nSometimes a researcher wants to study one specific person or event. A case study is an in-depth analysis of a single event, situation, or individual. To conduct a case study, a researcher examines existing sources like documents and archival records, conducts interviews, engages in direct observation and even participant observation, if possible.\\n Researchers might use this method to study a single case of a foster child, drug lord, cancer patient, criminal, or rape victim. However, a major criticism of the case study as a method is that while offering depth on a topic, it does not provide enough evidence to form a generalized conclusion. In other words, it is difficult to make universal claims based on just one person, since one person does not verify a pattern. This is why most sociologists do not use case studies as a primary research method.\\n However, case studies are useful when the single case is unique. In these instances, a single case study can contribute tremendous insight. For example, a feral child, also called “wild child,” is one who grows up isolated from human beings.</chunk8>\\n\\n<chunk9>Feral children grow up without social contact and language, which are elements crucial to a “civilized” child’s development. These children mimic the behaviors and movements of animals, and often invent their own language. There are only about one hundred cases of “feral children” in the world.\\n As you may imagine, a feral child is a subject of great interest to researchers. Feral children provide unique information about child development because they have grown up outside of the parameters of “normal” growth and nurturing. And since there are very few feral children, the case study is the most appropriate method for researchers to use in studying the subject.\\n At age three, a Ukranian girl named Oxana Malaya suffered severe parental neglect. She lived in a shed with dogs, and she ate raw meat and scraps. Five years later, a neighbor called authorities and reported seeing a girl who ran on all fours, barking. Officials brought Oxana into society, where she was cared for and taught some human behaviors, but she never became fully socialized. She has been designated as unable to support herself and now lives in a mental institution (Grice 2011). Case studies like this offer a way for sociologists to collect data that may not be obtained by any other method.\\n Experiments\\nYou have probably tested some of your own personal social theories. “If I study at night and review in the morning, I’ll improve my retention skills.” Or, “If I stop drinking soda, I’ll feel better.” Cause and effect. If this, then that. When you test the theory, your results either prove or disprove your hypothesis.\\n One way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment, meaning they investigate relationships to test a hypothesis—a scientific approach.\\n There are two main types of experiments: lab-based experiments and natural or field experiments. In a lab setting, the research can be controlled so that more data can be recorded in a limited amount of time. In a natural or field- based experiment, the time it takes to gather the data cannot be controlled but the information might be considered more accurate since it was collected without interference or intervention by the researcher.\\n As a research method, either type of sociological experiment is useful for testing if-then statements: if a particular thing happens (cause), then another particular thing will result (effect). To set up a lab-based experiment, sociologists create artificial situations that allow them to manipulate variables.\\n Classically, the sociologist selects a set of people with similar characteristics, such as age, class, race, or education. Those people are divided into two groups. One is the experimental group and the other is the control group. The experimental group is exposed to the independent variable(s) and the control group is not. To test the benefits of tutoring, for example, the sociologist might provide tutoring to the experimental group of students but not to the control group. Then both groups would be tested for differences in performance to see if tutoring had an effect on the experimental group of students.</chunk9>\\n\\n<chunk10>As you can imagine, in a case like this, the researcher would not want to jeopardize the accomplishments of either group of students, so the setting would be somewhat artificial. The test would not be for a grade reflected on their permanent record of a student, for example.\\n And if a researcher told the students they would be observed as part of a study on measuring the effectiveness of tutoring, the students might not behave naturally. This is called the Hawthorne effect—which occurs when people change their behavior because they know they are being watched as part of a study. The Hawthorne effect is unavoidable in some research studies because sociologists have to make the purpose of the study known. Subjects must be aware that they are being observed, and a certain amount of artificiality may result (Sonnenfeld 1985).\\n Figure 2.10 Sociologist Frances Heussenstamm conducted research to explore the correlation between traffic stops and race-based bumper stickers. This issue of racial profiling remains a hot-button topic today. (Credit: dwightsghost/flickr)\\n A real-life example will help illustrate the process. In 1971, Frances Heussenstamm, a sociology professor at California State University at Los Angeles, had a theory about police prejudice. To test her theory, she conducted research. She chose fifteen students from three ethnic backgrounds: Black, White, and Hispanic. She chose students who routinely drove to and from campus along Los Angeles freeway routes, and who had had perfect driving records for longer than a year.\\n Next, she placed a Black Panther bumper sticker on each car. That sticker, a representation of a social value, was the independent variable. In the 1970s, the Black Panthers were a revolutionary group actively fighting racism. Heussenstamm asked the students to follow their normal driving patterns. She wanted to see whether seeming support for the Black Panthers would change how these good drivers were treated by the police patrolling the highways. The dependent variable would be the number of traffic stops/citations.\\n The first arrest, for an incorrect lane change, was made two hours after the experiment began. One participant was pulled over three times in three days. He quit the study. After seventeen days, the fifteen drivers had collected a total of thirty-three traffic citations. The research was halted. The funding to pay traffic fines had run out, and so had the enthusiasm of the participants (Heussenstamm, 1971).\\n Secondary Data Analysis\\nWhile sociologists often engage in original research studies, they also contribute knowledge to the discipline through secondary data analysis. Secondary data does not result from firsthand research collected from primary sources, but are the already completed work of other researchers or data collected by an agency or organization. Sociologists might study works written by historians, economists, teachers, or early sociologists. They might search through periodicals, newspapers, or magazines, or organizational data from any period in history.\\n Using available information not only saves time and money but can also add depth to a study. Sociologists often interpret findings in a new way, a way that was not part of an author’s original purpose or intention.</chunk10>\\n\\n<chunk11>To study how women were encouraged to act and behave in the 1960s, for example, a researcher might watch movies, televisions shows, and situation comedies from that period. Or to research changes in behavior and attitudes due to the emergence of television in the late 1950s and early 1960s, a sociologist would rely on new interpretations of secondary data. Decades from now, researchers will most likely conduct similar studies on the advent of mobile phones, the Internet, or social media.\\n Social scientists also learn by analyzing the research of a variety of agencies. Governmental departments and global groups, like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or the World Health Organization (WHO), publish studies with findings that are useful to sociologists. A public statistic like the foreclosure rate might be useful for studying the effects of a recession. A racial demographic profile might be compared with data on education funding to examine the resources accessible by different groups.\\n One of the advantages of secondary data like old movies or WHO statistics is that it is nonreactive research (or unobtrusive research), meaning that it does not involve direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people’s behaviors. Unlike studies requiring direct contact with people, using previously published data does not require entering a population and the investment and risks inherent in that research process.\\n Using available data does have its challenges. Public records are not always easy to access. A researcher will need to do some legwork to track them down and gain access to records. To guide the search through a vast library of materials and avoid wasting time reading unrelated sources, sociologists employ content analysis, applying a systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from secondary data as they relate to the study at hand.\\n Also, in some cases, there is no way to verify the accuracy of existing data. It is easy to count how many drunk drivers, for example, are pulled over by the police. But how many are not? While it’s possible to discover the percentage of teenage students who drop out of high school, it might be more challenging to determine the number who return to school or get their GED later.\\n Another problem arises when data are unavailable in the exact form needed or do not survey the topic from the precise angle the researcher seeks. For example, the average salaries paid to professors at a public school is public record. But these figures do not necessarily reveal how long it took each professor to reach the salary range, what their educational backgrounds are, or how long they’ve been teaching.\\n When conducting content analysis, it is important to consider the date of publication of an existing source and to take into account attitudes and common cultural ideals that may have influenced the research. For example, when Robert S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd gathered research in the 1920s, attitudes and cultural norms were vastly different then than they are now. Beliefs about gender roles, race, education, and work have changed significantly since then. At the time, the study’s purpose was to reveal insights about small U.S. communities. Today, it is an illustration of 1920s attitudes and values.</chunk11>\\n\\n<chunk12></chunk12>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 1 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 1 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

The Nielsen Ratings determine the popularity of television programming through scientific market research. However, polls conducted by television programs such as American Idol or So You Think You Can Dance cannot be generalized, because they are administered to an unrepresentative population, a specific show’s audience. You might receive polls through your cell phones or emails, from grocery stores, restaurants, and retail stores. They often provide you incentives for completing the survey.\\n Figure 2.4 Real-time surveys are common in classrooms, live-audience events, and even popular media. Twitter polls have often replaced physical devices such as the one pictured. (Credit: Sam Howzit/flickr)\\nSociologists conduct surveys under controlled conditions for specific purposes. Surveys gather different types of information from people. While surveys are not great at capturing the ways people really behave in social situations, they are a great method for discovering how people feel, think, and act—or at least how they say they feel, think, and act. Surveys can track preferences for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors (such as sleeping, driving, or texting habits) or information such as employment status, income, and education levels.\\n A survey targets a specific population, people who are the focus of a study, such as college athletes, international students, or teenagers living with type 1 (juvenile-onset) diabetes. Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population, or a sample, a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population. The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample. In a random sample, every person in a population has the same chance of being chosen for the study. As a result, a Gallup Poll, if conducted as a nationwide random sampling, should be able to provide an accurate estimate of public opinion whether it contacts 2,000 or 10,000 people.\\n After selecting subjects, the researcher develops a specific plan to ask questions and record responses. It is important to inform subjects of the nature and purpose of the survey up front. If they agree to participate, researchers thank subjects and offer them a chance to see the results of the study if they are interested. The researcher presents the subjects with an instrument, which is a means of gathering the information.\\n A common instrument is a questionnaire. Subjects often answer a series of closed-ended questions. The researcher might ask yes-or-no or multiple-choice questions, allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question. This kind of questionnaire collects quantitative data—data in numerical form that can be counted and statistically analyzed. Just count up the number of “yes” and “no” responses or correct answers, and chart them into percentages.\\n Questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers—beyond “yes,” “no,” or checkbox options. These types of inquiries use open-ended questions that require short essay responses.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nSociologists use various research methods like surveys, field research, experiments, and secondary data analysis to study social patterns. The method choice depends on the topic. Anonymity and careful planning are crucial in sociological research design. Interviews, a form of survey, offer deeper insights into personal experiences. Researchers face challenges with qualitative data as it varies widely among individuals. Surveys can be conducted in various methods, like online or face-to-face, sometimes merging with field research. Field research involves interacting with subjects in their natural environments, like a village or a beach, to observe behaviors. It identifies correlations rather than causations due to numerous influencing variables. Participant observation allows researchers to experience social dynamics firsthand, as seen in examples like Rothman's study. However, it requires careful participation and can blur observer-participant roles. Researchers like Barbara Ehrenreich explore various work environments using participant observation. Such studies offer qualitative insights into societal issues like low-wage work. Ethnography immerses researchers in communities, focusing on subjects' perspectives and social roles. This method traces cultural norms and everyday life in specific contexts, such as tribal or religious communities. Case studies provide in-depth exploration of unique situations or subjects. They are criticized for lack of generalizability but are valuable for understanding atypical phenomena. Experiments test hypotheses within controlled settings to understand cause-effect relationships. The methodology uses experimental and control groups to evaluate variables. Researchers face challenges like the Hawthorne effect in experiments, affecting natural behavior. Heussenstamm's experiment illustrates racial profiling through a systematic approach. Secondary data analysis involves using existing data for research while being mindful of historical biases and limitations.

You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYour task is to write an inferential multiple-choice question (see [DEFINITION]) based on an inference provided by the user. \\nThis inference will be directly supported by a \"source text\", which is an excerpt from the academic material. \\nA \"contextual text\" will also be provided to help you understand the broader meaning and useage of the source text. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\nNOTE: The user may provide an already generated question with evaluations, in which case you should revise the provided question based on the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] and the evaluations.\\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are inferential questions?**\\nInferential questions require students to go beyond the explicit information in a text and draw conclusions based on evidence, reasoning, and prior knowledge. Unlike literal questions, which ask for directly stated facts, inferential questions challenge students to interpret, analyze, or predict based on textual clues.\\nFor example, \\nExcerpt:\\n\"Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to stress can negatively impact cognitive function, particularly memory and decision-making. This is because chronic stress leads to an overproduction of cortisol, a hormone that, in excessive amounts, has been linked to neural atrophy in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory formation.\"\\nLiteral Question:\\n\"What is one effect of chronic stress on the brain?\"\\n(Answer: Neural atrophy in the hippocampus, affecting memory formation.)\\nInferential Question:\\n\"Why might individuals in high-stress professions experience difficulty making decisions?\"\\n(Reasoning and Answer: The passage states that chronic stress impairs cognitive functions like decision-making. Since high-stress professions expose individuals to prolonged stress, they may experience cognitive difficulties due to excessive cortisol affecting brain regions involved in these functions.)\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Summarize your understanding of what inferential questions are. \\nStep2: Based on the inference, source text, and contextual text, write a question about the inference. \\n  - Focus the question on the inference.\\n  - Use clear and concise language; avoid overly complex or wordy constructions.\\n  - Omit unnecessary introductory phrases such as \"According to the text,\" \"Based on the source,\" or \"According to the passage\\nStep3: Provide a correct answer to the inferential question based on the inference, the source text, and the contextual text. The correct answer should:\\n  - Be indisputably correct based on the text.\\n  - Try not to use words that are in the question.\\n  - Avoid wording that could make multiple answers seem correct.\\nStep4: Provide three plausible distractors based on the text. The distractors should:\\n  - Avoid obviously wrong or ridiculous choices.\\n  - Be plausible and logically parallel but incorrect based on the text. \\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer. \\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      Example: \\n      Why is peer review important in academic research?\\n        A) It ensures that every mistake is caught before publication. (Unrealistic exaggeration.)\\n        B) It contributes to the credibility and validity of research. (correct answer)\\n        C) It completely eliminates the risk of bias. (Overly absolute, sounds implausible.)\\n        D) It allows only the best scientists to publish. (Overgeneralized and elitist; not a common misconception.)\\n      Note: The distractors are poor because they do not mirror student thinking—they simply sound extreme or silly, weakening the item\\'s quality.\\n  **Example with good distractors**\\n    What can be inferred about the effects of confirmation bias on how people process new information?\\n      A) People are generally open to changing their beliefs when presented with neutral evidence. (distractor)\\n      B) Confirmation bias can cause people to misinterpret information that contradicts their existing beliefs. (correct answer)\\n      C) The presence of conflicting data usually prompts people to reevaluate their assumptions objectively. (distractor)\\n      D) Individuals who hold strong opinions are less likely to be influenced by various types of evidence. (distractor)\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice inferential question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice inferential question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the likely cause of the decrease in energy at each succeeding trophic level in an ecosystem?\\n  \\\\nA) The inefficient capture and consumption of food by organisms\\n  \\\\nB) The availability of sunlight for photosynthesis\\n  \\\\nC) The decrease in the number of autotrophs\\n  \\\\nD) The high metabolic rate of consumers</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags.

They use research methods to design a study. Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study. Sociologists generally choose from widely used methods of social investigation: primary source data collection such as survey, participant observation, ethnography, case study, unobtrusive observations, experiment, and secondary data analysis, or use of existing sources. Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use. When you are conducting research think about the best way to gather or obtain knowledge about your topic, think of yourself as an architect. An architect needs a blueprint to build a house, as a sociologist your blueprint is your research design including your data collection method.\\n When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being observed. A researcher wouldn’t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, “Any gang members around?”\\n Making sociologists’ presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers can’t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe behaviors or attract attention. In situations like these, other methods are needed. Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics, protect research participants or subjects, and that fit with their overall approaches to research.\\n Surveys\\nAs a research method, a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire or an interview. The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in which they can express personal ideas.\\n Figure 2.3 Questionnaires are a common research method. (Credit: CDC Global/flickr)\\n At some point, most people in the United States respond to some type of survey. The 2020 U.S. Census is an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Since 1790, United States has conducted a survey consisting of six questions to received demographical data pertaining to residents. The questions pertain to the demographics of the residents who live in the United States. Currently, the Census is received by residents in the United Stated and five territories and consists of 12 questions.\\n Not all surveys are considered sociological research, however, and many surveys people commonly encounter focus on identifying marketing needs and strategies rather than testing a hypothesis or contributing to social science knowledge.\\nThe researcher interacts with or observes people and gathers data along the way. The key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject’s natural environment, whether it’s a coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.\\n Figure 2.5 Sociological researchers travel across countries and cultures to interact with and observe subjects in their natural environments. (Credit: IMLS Digital Collections and Content/flickr)\\n While field research often begins in a specific setting, the study’s purpose is to observe specific behaviors in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing how people think and behave. It seeks to understand why they behave that way. However, researchers may struggle to narrow down cause and effect when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment. And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables. Indeed, much of the data gathered in sociology do not identify a cause and effect but a correlation.\\n Figure 2.6 Researchers have used surveys and participant observations to accumulate data on Lady Gaga and Beyonce as multifaceted performers. (Credit a: John Robert Chartlon/flickr, b: Kristopher Harris/flickr.)\\n Sociologists have studied Lady Gaga and Beyoncé and their impact on music, movies, social media, fan participation, and social equality. In their studies, researchers have used several research methods including secondary analysis, participant observation, and surveys from concert participants.\\n In their study, Click, Lee & Holiday (2013) interviewed 45 Lady Gaga fans who utilized social media to communicate with the artist. These fans viewed Lady Gaga as a mirror of themselves and a source of inspiration. Like her, they embrace not being a part of mainstream culture. Many of Lady Gaga’s fans are members of the LGBTQ community. They see the “song “Born This Way” as a rallying cry and answer her calls for “Paws Up” with a physical expression of solidarity—outstretched arms and ﬁngers bent and curled to resemble monster claws.”\\n Sascha Buchanan (2019) made use of participant observation to study the relationship between two fan groups, that of Beyoncé and that of Rihanna. She observed award shows sponsored by iHeartRadio, MTV EMA, and BET that pit one group against another as they competed for Best Fan Army, Biggest Fans, and FANdemonium. Buchanan argues that the media thus sustains a myth of rivalry between the two most commercially successful Black women vocal artists.\\nParticipant Observation\\nIn 2000, a comic writer named Rodney Rothman wanted an insider’s view of white-collar work. He slipped into the sterile, high-rise offices of a New York “dot com” agency. Every day for two weeks, he pretended to work there. His main purpose was simply to see whether anyone would notice him or challenge his presence. No one did. The receptionist greeted him. The employees smiled and said good morning. Rothman was accepted as part of the team. He even went so far as to claim a desk, inform the receptionist of his whereabouts, and attend a meeting. He published an article about his experience in The New Yorker called “My Fake Job” (2000). Later, he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology. However, Rothman’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “dot com” company and exemplified the lengths to which a writer, or a sociologist, will go to uncover material.\\n Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation, in which researchers join people and participate in a group’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context. This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life. A researcher might go to great lengths to get a firsthand look into a trend, institution, or behavior. A researcher might work as a waitress in a diner, experience homelessness for several weeks, or ride along with police officers as they patrol their regular beat. Often, these researchers try to blend in seamlessly with the population they study, and they may not disclose their true identity or purpose if they feel it would compromise the results of their research.\\n Figure 2.7 Is she a working waitress or a sociologist conducting a study using participant observation? A field researcher may take a job or take other steps to get firsthand knowledge of their subjects. (Credit: Gareth Williams/flickr.)\\n At the beginning of a field study, researchers might have a question: “What really goes on in the kitchen of the most popular diner on campus?” or “What is it like to be homeless?” Participant observation is a useful method if the researcher wants to explore a certain environment from the inside.\\n Field researchers simply want to observe and learn. In such a setting, the researcher will be alert and open minded to whatever happens, recording all observations accurately. Soon, as patterns emerge, questions will become more specific, observations will lead to hypotheses, and hypotheses will guide the researcher in analyzing data and generating results.\\n In a study of small towns in the United States conducted by sociological researchers John S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd, the team altered their purpose as they gathered data. They initially planned to focus their study on the role of religion in U.S. towns. As they gathered observations, they realized that the effect of industrialization and urbanization was the more relevant topic of this social group. The Lynds did not change their methods, but they revised the purpose of their study.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nSurveys target specific populations and gather data on behaviors and opinions. They can provide quantitative and qualitative data but may not reflect true social behavior. Success depends on effective sampling and designing the questions thoughtfully. Interviews, a form of survey, offer deeper insights into personal experiences. Researchers face challenges with qualitative data as it varies widely among individuals. Surveys can be conducted in various methods, like online or face-to-face, sometimes merging with field research. Researchers like Barbara Ehrenreich explore various work environments using participant observation. Such studies offer qualitative insights into societal issues like low-wage work. Ethnography immerses researchers in communities, focusing on subjects' perspectives and social roles. This method traces cultural norms and everyday life in specific contexts, such as tribal or religious communities. Case studies provide in-depth exploration of unique situations or subjects. They are criticized for lack of generalizability but are valuable for understanding atypical phenomena. Experiments test hypotheses within controlled settings to understand cause-effect relationships. The methodology uses experimental and control groups to evaluate variables. Researchers face challenges like the Hawthorne effect in experiments, affecting natural behavior. Heussenstamm's experiment illustrates racial profiling through a systematic approach. Secondary data analysis involves using existing data for research while being mindful of historical biases and limitations. This method preserves objectivity but requires careful source selection. \\n</contextual_text>\\n\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

The method choice depends on the topic. Anonymity and careful planning are crucial in sociological research design. Surveys target specific populations and gather data on behaviors and opinions. They can provide quantitative and qualitative data but may not reflect true social behavior. Success depends on effective sampling and designing the questions thoughtfully. Interviews, a form of survey, offer deeper insights into personal experiences. Researchers face challenges with qualitative data as it varies widely among individuals. Surveys can be conducted in various methods, like online or face-to-face, sometimes merging with field research. Field research involves interacting with subjects in their natural environments, like a village or a beach, to observe behaviors. It identifies correlations rather than causations due to numerous influencing variables. Participant observation allows researchers to experience social dynamics firsthand, as seen in examples like Rothman's study. However, it requires careful participation and can blur observer-participant roles. Researchers like Barbara Ehrenreich explore various work environments using participant observation. Such studies offer qualitative insights into societal issues like low-wage work. Ethnography immerses researchers in communities, focusing on subjects' perspectives and social roles. This method traces cultural norms and everyday life in specific contexts, such as tribal or religious communities. Case studies provide in-depth exploration of unique situations or subjects. They are criticized for lack of generalizability but are valuable for understanding atypical phenomena. Experiments test hypotheses within controlled settings to understand cause-effect relationships. The methodology uses experimental and control groups to evaluate variables. Researchers face challenges like the Hawthorne effect in experiments, affecting natural behavior. Heussenstamm's experiment illustrates racial profiling through a systematic approach. Secondary data analysis involves using existing data for research while being mindful of historical biases and limitations.

The Nielsen Ratings determine the popularity of television programming through scientific market research. However, polls conducted by television programs such as American Idol or So You Think You Can Dance cannot be generalized, because they are administered to an unrepresentative population, a specific show’s audience. You might receive polls through your cell phones or emails, from grocery stores, restaurants, and retail stores. They often provide you incentives for completing the survey.\\n Figure 2.4 Real-time surveys are common in classrooms, live-audience events, and even popular media. Twitter polls have often replaced physical devices such as the one pictured. (Credit: Sam Howzit/flickr)\\nSociologists conduct surveys under controlled conditions for specific purposes. Surveys gather different types of information from people. While surveys are not great at capturing the ways people really behave in social situations, they are a great method for discovering how people feel, think, and act—or at least how they say they feel, think, and act. Surveys can track preferences for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors (such as sleeping, driving, or texting habits) or information such as employment status, income, and education levels.\\n A survey targets a specific population, people who are the focus of a study, such as college athletes, international students, or teenagers living with type 1 (juvenile-onset) diabetes. Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population, or a sample, a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population. The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample. In a random sample, every person in a population has the same chance of being chosen for the study. As a result, a Gallup Poll, if conducted as a nationwide random sampling, should be able to provide an accurate estimate of public opinion whether it contacts 2,000 or 10,000 people.\\n After selecting subjects, the researcher develops a specific plan to ask questions and record responses. It is important to inform subjects of the nature and purpose of the survey up front. If they agree to participate, researchers thank subjects and offer them a chance to see the results of the study if they are interested. The researcher presents the subjects with an instrument, which is a means of gathering the information.\\n A common instrument is a questionnaire. Subjects often answer a series of closed-ended questions. The researcher might ask yes-or-no or multiple-choice questions, allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question. This kind of questionnaire collects quantitative data—data in numerical form that can be counted and statistically analyzed. Just count up the number of “yes” and “no” responses or correct answers, and chart them into percentages.\\n Questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers—beyond “yes,” “no,” or checkbox options. These types of inquiries use open-ended questions that require short essay responses.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\nSociologists use various research methods like surveys, field research, experiments, and secondary data analysis to study social patterns.

They use research methods to design a study. Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study. Sociologists generally choose from widely used methods of social investigation: primary source data collection such as survey, participant observation, ethnography, case study, unobtrusive observations, experiment, and secondary data analysis, or use of existing sources. Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use. When you are conducting research think about the best way to gather or obtain knowledge about your topic, think of yourself as an architect. An architect needs a blueprint to build a house, as a sociologist your blueprint is your research design including your data collection method.\\n When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being observed. A researcher wouldn’t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, “Any gang members around?”\\n Making sociologists’ presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers can’t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe behaviors or attract attention. In situations like these, other methods are needed. Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics, protect research participants or subjects, and that fit with their overall approaches to research.\\n Surveys\\nAs a research method, a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire or an interview. The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in which they can express personal ideas.\\n Figure 2.3 Questionnaires are a common research method. (Credit: CDC Global/flickr)\\n At some point, most people in the United States respond to some type of survey. The 2020 U.S. Census is an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Since 1790, United States has conducted a survey consisting of six questions to received demographical data pertaining to residents. The questions pertain to the demographics of the residents who live in the United States. Currently, the Census is received by residents in the United Stated and five territories and consists of 12 questions.\\n Not all surveys are considered sociological research, however, and many surveys people commonly encounter focus on identifying marketing needs and strategies rather than testing a hypothesis or contributing to social science knowledge.\\nThe researcher interacts with or observes people and gathers data along the way. The key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject’s natural environment, whether it’s a coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.\\n Figure 2.5 Sociological researchers travel across countries and cultures to interact with and observe subjects in their natural environments. (Credit: IMLS Digital Collections and Content/flickr)\\n While field research often begins in a specific setting, the study’s purpose is to observe specific behaviors in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing how people think and behave. It seeks to understand why they behave that way. However, researchers may struggle to narrow down cause and effect when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment. And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables. Indeed, much of the data gathered in sociology do not identify a cause and effect but a correlation.\\n Figure 2.6 Researchers have used surveys and participant observations to accumulate data on Lady Gaga and Beyonce as multifaceted performers. (Credit a: John Robert Chartlon/flickr, b: Kristopher Harris/flickr.)\\n Sociologists have studied Lady Gaga and Beyoncé and their impact on music, movies, social media, fan participation, and social equality. In their studies, researchers have used several research methods including secondary analysis, participant observation, and surveys from concert participants.\\n In their study, Click, Lee & Holiday (2013) interviewed 45 Lady Gaga fans who utilized social media to communicate with the artist. These fans viewed Lady Gaga as a mirror of themselves and a source of inspiration. Like her, they embrace not being a part of mainstream culture. Many of Lady Gaga’s fans are members of the LGBTQ community. They see the “song “Born This Way” as a rallying cry and answer her calls for “Paws Up” with a physical expression of solidarity—outstretched arms and ﬁngers bent and curled to resemble monster claws.”\\n Sascha Buchanan (2019) made use of participant observation to study the relationship between two fan groups, that of Beyoncé and that of Rihanna. She observed award shows sponsored by iHeartRadio, MTV EMA, and BET that pit one group against another as they competed for Best Fan Army, Biggest Fans, and FANdemonium. Buchanan argues that the media thus sustains a myth of rivalry between the two most commercially successful Black women vocal artists.\\nParticipant Observation\\nIn 2000, a comic writer named Rodney Rothman wanted an insider’s view of white-collar work. He slipped into the sterile, high-rise offices of a New York “dot com” agency. Every day for two weeks, he pretended to work there. His main purpose was simply to see whether anyone would notice him or challenge his presence. No one did. The receptionist greeted him. The employees smiled and said good morning. Rothman was accepted as part of the team. He even went so far as to claim a desk, inform the receptionist of his whereabouts, and attend a meeting. He published an article about his experience in The New Yorker called “My Fake Job” (2000). Later, he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology. However, Rothman’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “dot com” company and exemplified the lengths to which a writer, or a sociologist, will go to uncover material.\\n Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation, in which researchers join people and participate in a group’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context. This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life. A researcher might go to great lengths to get a firsthand look into a trend, institution, or behavior. A researcher might work as a waitress in a diner, experience homelessness for several weeks, or ride along with police officers as they patrol their regular beat. Often, these researchers try to blend in seamlessly with the population they study, and they may not disclose their true identity or purpose if they feel it would compromise the results of their research.\\n Figure 2.7 Is she a working waitress or a sociologist conducting a study using participant observation? A field researcher may take a job or take other steps to get firsthand knowledge of their subjects. (Credit: Gareth Williams/flickr.)\\n At the beginning of a field study, researchers might have a question: “What really goes on in the kitchen of the most popular diner on campus?” or “What is it like to be homeless?” Participant observation is a useful method if the researcher wants to explore a certain environment from the inside.\\n Field researchers simply want to observe and learn. In such a setting, the researcher will be alert and open minded to whatever happens, recording all observations accurately. Soon, as patterns emerge, questions will become more specific, observations will lead to hypotheses, and hypotheses will guide the researcher in analyzing data and generating results.\\n In a study of small towns in the United States conducted by sociological researchers John S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd, the team altered their purpose as they gathered data. They initially planned to focus their study on the role of religion in U.S. towns. As they gathered observations, they realized that the effect of industrialization and urbanization was the more relevant topic of this social group. The Lynds did not change their methods, but they revised the purpose of their study.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\nSurveys target specific populations and gather data on behaviors and opinions. They can provide quantitative and qualitative data but may not reflect true social behavior. Success depends on effective sampling and designing the questions thoughtfully. Interviews, a form of survey, offer deeper insights into personal experiences. Researchers face challenges with qualitative data as it varies widely among individuals. Surveys can be conducted in various methods, like online or face-to-face, sometimes merging with field research. Researchers like Barbara Ehrenreich explore various work environments using participant observation. Such studies offer qualitative insights into societal issues like low-wage work. Ethnography immerses researchers in communities, focusing on subjects' perspectives and social roles. This method traces cultural norms and everyday life in specific contexts, such as tribal or religious communities. Case studies provide in-depth exploration of unique situations or subjects. They are criticized for lack of generalizability but are valuable for understanding atypical phenomena. Experiments test hypotheses within controlled settings to understand cause-effect relationships. The methodology uses experimental and control groups to evaluate variables. Researchers face challenges like the Hawthorne effect in experiments, affecting natural behavior. Heussenstamm's experiment illustrates racial profiling through a systematic approach. Secondary data analysis involves using existing data for research while being mindful of historical biases and limitations. This method preserves objectivity but requires careful source selection. \\n</contextual_text>\"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

    "{'system_prompt': '[ROLE]:\\nYou are an experienced college instructor. You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYou are asked to write a main idea multiple-choice question based on an academic text summary provided by the user. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\nNOTE: The user may provide an already generated question with evaluations, in which case you should revise the provided question based on the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] and the evaluations.\\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are main idea questions?**\\nMain idea questions assess a student\\'s ability to identify the central point or primary argument of a text, passage, or section.\\nInstead of focusing on specific details, examples, or minor points, these questions target the big picture — what the author is fundamentally trying to convey.\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Carefully read the TEXT to understand its main idea.  \\nStep2: Write a clear question stem. Typical stems include:\\n  - \"Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\"\\n  - \"What is the primary purpose of the text?\"\\n  - \"What is the central argument of the article?\"\\nStep3: Create the correct answer option. \\n  - It should accurately reflect the main idea.\\n  - It should be broad enough to cover the whole passage but specific enough to show real understanding.\\n  - It should use words that are in the question sparingly.\\nStep4: Write three plausible distractors. Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, completely, always, never, purely, every, only) unless they accurately reflect real-world absolutes\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.\\n  \\\\nB) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nC) Most companies now require employees to work remotely.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags. The answer should contain the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D) and the text of the correct answer. Example:\\n<ANSWER>A) Remote work has recently become more common because of its benefits to companies.</ANSWER>\\n', 'user_prompt': '<text>\\nThe section outlines learning objectives for understanding the geographical and cultural context of West Africa, highlighting the significance of Islam, the diversity of the region, and the social and political structures that dominated pre-colonial West Africa. It describes how Islam spread across the region, influencing trade and political dynamics, and notes the different agricultural practices and social structures of West African societies.This section describes the rise of major African empires such as Ghana, Mali, and Songhay, emphasizing their political and economic power, particularly through control of trade routes. It also covers the role and development of slavery within these empires, illustrating various forms of servitude and highlighting how Islamic influences expanded the slave trade beyond Africa.The text discusses how the European slave trade developed, focusing on the role of Portugal and other European countries in expanding the demand for enslaved Africans. It shows how slavery evolved into a race-based system in the New World, with significant impacts on African societies and a lasting legacy in the Americas.\\n</text>', 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'completion': 'Reasoning:\\n\\nStep 1: After reviewing the provided text, the main idea revolves around the historical and cultural dynamics of pre-colonial and colonial West Africa. The text highlights the role of Islam, trade, political and social structures, and the development of slavery within African empires, and how European interests expanded the slave trade and its effects.\\n\\nStep 2: Writing the question stem, I will ask about the overall theme or purpose of the passage.\\n\\nStep 3: The correct answer needs to encapsulate the broad overview of West African history, the rise of empires, the influence of Islam, and the evolution of slavery due to European involvement.\\n\\nStep 4: Distractors need to misdirect by focusing on isolated details or suggest incorrect interpretations, but remain plausible.\\n\\nStep 5: Check that the correct answer is not significantly longer than the distractors.\\n\\nStep 6: Review all components to ensure clarity and accuracy.\\n\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) The achievements of West African rulers in expanding their territories.\\n  \\\\nB) The diverse agricultural practices that sustained West African societies.\\n  \\\\nC) The historical development and importance of West Africa, with a focus on Islam, trade, and the evolution of slavery.\\n  \\\\nD) The exclusive impact of European colonization on West African political systems.</QUESTION>\\n\\n<ANSWER>C) The historical development and importance of West Africa, with a focus on Islam, trade, and the evolution of slavery.</ANSWER>', \n",
