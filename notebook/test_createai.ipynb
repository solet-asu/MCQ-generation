       "'[ROLE]:\\n  You are an experienced college instructor specializing in developing reading comprehension questions to evaluate students\\' understanding of academic texts, such as textbook chapters and academic articles. You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n  - Return ONLY a JSON object matching the JSON format specified above. No prose, no explanations, no code fences.\\n\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'"

The campaigns to get people out of the sun have gone too far, according to the researcher Johan Moan. â€œThe rays of the sun speed up the bodyâ€™s production of vitamin D. This can prevent cancer as well as many other diseases.â€\\x9d So says Johan Moan, Professor at the Cancer Center at Boston Medical Center. Along with colleagues from Norway, he is presenting results that support the theory that sun exposure provides the body with a more effective defense against cancer. The findings show, for example, that people who live closer to the equator, and whose bodies hence are more exposed to the sun, have a better chance of survival if they develop cancer in their internal organs. Moreover, they show that cancer patients have a better prognosis if they are diagnosed in summer or autumn, when their store of vitamin D has been replenished. Their research has been published in the prestigious scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Sunbathing or cod-liver oil is important to northerners\\nVitamin D has also been shown to play a protective role in many types of cancer of internal organs, and possibly also for a number of other diseases. Avoiding the sun can thus do more harm than good, according to Richard Setlow, who is one of Moanâ€™s collaborators. He thinks that this applies especially to us northerners, who see little of the sun for long periods of the year. Setlow is a biophysicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and is one of the worldâ€™s most recognized experts on the relationship between solar radiation and skin cancer.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\n\\n</contextual_text>\",\n",

If you stay outside for half an hour in midsummer, you obtain the same amount of vitamin D as you would from drinking a small bottle of cod-liver oil,â€\\x9d Moan says.

During this period, Europe experienced political and military discord, with people retreating into walled cities for protection from various invaders. The Christian Church remained a unified and powerful institution, with priests preserving knowledge in monasteries. The Black Death devastated Europe in the 1340s, killing about one-third of the population. By 1450, European society was rejuvenating and on the brink of significant change. Most Europeans lived in small feudal villages consisting of a manorial house or castle for the lord, a church, and simple homes for peasants or serfs. Europe's feudal society was mutually supportive, with lords owning land, knights providing military service, and serfs working the land in exchange for protection.\",\n",

The Catholic Church owned vast tracts of land and became wealthy through tithes and rents. Life was harsh, with women often dying in childbirth, high child mortality, and few people living past 45. Families lived in small, cold, dark hovels with minimal possessions. The rhythm of life followed the agricultural seasons, with specific tasks for each time of year. Everyone worked hard to survive, with bad weather or crop failures potentially causing starvation.\",\n",

The Roman Catholic Church became the most powerful international organization in western Europe, with a strict hierarchy led by the pope. Village and family life revolved around the Church and its sacraments. Christianity replaced pagan views, explaining supernatural events in religious terms. The Church held enormous power, with priests interpreting the Bible for the mostly illiterate population. In 622, Islam emerged as a new challenge to Christendom. Following Muhammad's death in 632, Islam spread through conversion and military conquest across the Middle East, Asia Minor, India, northern Africa, and into Spain by 711.\",\n",

The section then discusses Jerusalem as a holy site for Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and describes the Crusades that began in 1095 when European Christians decided to retake the holy city from Muslim rulers. Religious zeal, adventure, land acquisition, and forgiveness of sins motivated knights to participate. The Crusaders retook Jerusalem in 1099 amid horrific slaughter, but Muslim forces under Saladin recaptured it in 1187.\",\n",

On the positive side, maritime trade between East and West expanded as Europeans desired silk, spices, and porcelain. Venice prospered enormously from trade with Islamic merchants. However, transporting goods along the old Silk Road was costly and dangerous, prompting the search for a direct water route to the East. The section then shifts to the Iberian Peninsula, where Portugal under Prince Henry the Navigator fostered exploration of and trade with western Africa. In 1469, King Ferdinand of Aragon married Queen Isabella of Castile, uniting two powerful kingdoms and laying the foundation for modern Spain.

The year 1492 was significant for Ferdinand and Isabella's reign, as they oversaw the final expulsion of North African Muslims from Granada, ending the nearly 800-year Reconquista, and ordered all unconverted Jews to leave Spain.
