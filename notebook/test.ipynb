       "'<chunk1>Research magazine from Stanford University Journalist Anne Simonson â€“ January 13, 2008 The sun counteracts cancer\\nSunrays that hit our skin reinforce the bodyâ€™s own defense against cancer. The campaigns to get people out of the sun have gone too far, according to the researcher Johan Moan. â€œThe rays of the sun speed up the bodyâ€™s production of vitamin D. This can prevent cancer as well as many other diseases.â€\\x9d So says Johan Moan, Professor at the Cancer Center at Boston Medical Center. Along with colleagues from Norway, he is presenting results that support the theory that sun exposure provides the body with a more effective defense against cancer. The findings show, for example, that people who live closer to the equator, and whose bodies hence are more exposed to the sun, have a better chance of survival if they develop cancer in their internal organs. Moreover, they show that cancer patients have a better prognosis if they are diagnosed in summer or autumn, when their store of vitamin D has been replenished. Their research has been published in the prestigious scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Sunbathing or cod-liver oil is important to northerners\\nVitamin D has also been shown to play a protective role in many types of cancer of internal organs, and possibly also for a number of other diseases. Avoiding the sun can thus do more harm than good, according to Richard Setlow, who is one of Moanâ€™s collaborators. He thinks that this applies especially to us northerners, who see little of the sun for long periods of the year. Setlow is a biophysicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and is one of the worldâ€™s most recognized experts on the relationship between solar radiation and skin cancer.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>â€œPeople are being advised to spend less time in the sun, but some sun without sunscreen is healthy for us. If you stay outside for half an hour in midsummer, you obtain the same amount of vitamin D as you would from drinking a small bottle of cod-liver oil,â€\\x9d Moan says. He claims that in addition, it would be beneficial to use a tanning bed once or twice a week during the dark winter months, because this provides an excellent supplement of vitamin D at that time of year. â€œFrom November to March we obtain no vitamin D from the sun, and we therefore need to ingest it or obtain it from a tanning bed,â€\\x9d Moan explains. Melanomas are triggered by the type of solar radiation known as UVA. The bodyâ€™s production of vitamin D is stimulated by the type of solar radiation known as UVB. Perhaps we should change the sunscreens so that they do not block as much of the UVB radiation, while still protecting us against the UVA rays, according to Setlow.\\n</chunk2>'"

You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Research magazine from Stanford University Journalist Anne Simonson â€“ January 13, 2008 The sun counteracts cancer\\nSunrays that hit our skin reinforce the bodyâ€™s own defense against cancer.

       "{'system_prompt': '[ROLE]:\\n  You are an experienced college instructor specializing in developing reading comprehension questions to evaluate students\\' understanding of academic texts, such as textbook chapters and academic articles. You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences generated in this step can be more than what the user requests. \\n  \\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  **Principles for Identifying Key Facts and Inferences**\\n    - Focus on Central Ideas: Identify the main argument, thesis, or purpose of the text.\\n    - Highlight Supporting Information: Look for facts, evidence, definitions, or examples that directly support the main ideas.\\n    - Pay Attention to Logical Relationships: Note cause-effect, comparison, contrast, and sequence relationships that organize the information.\\n    - Recognize Implied Meaning: Infer what the author suggests but does not say directly—such as assumptions, tone, or implications.\\n    - Ignore peripheral details: Exclude minor details (e.g., time, location), anecdotes, or examples that do not contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the text.\\n    - Prioritize What’s Essential for Understanding: Choose facts and inferences that are crucial for grasping the overall meaning or structure of the text.\\n    - Avoid redundancy: Do not include the same fact or inference multiple times, even if it appears in different chunks.\\n    - Pay special attention to Learning/Teaching Objectives if they are provided in the text, as they often highlight the most important concepts or skills that the text aims to convey. \\n  \\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n',\n",

If no clear logical order exists, use alphabetical order instead. \\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n  - Ensure that all options are ordered logically or alphabetically.\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice factual question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice factual question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags.

You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYour task is to write an inferential multiple-choice question (see [DEFINITION]) based on an inference provided by the user. \\nThis inference will be directly supported by a \"source text\", which is an excerpt from the academic material. \\nA \"contextual text\" will also be provided to help you understand the broader meaning and useage of the source text. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\nNOTE: The user may provide an already generated question with evaluations, in which case you should revise the provided question based on the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] and the evaluations.\\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are inferential questions?**\\nInferential questions require students to go beyond the explicit information in a text and draw conclusions based on evidence, reasoning, and prior knowledge. Unlike literal questions, which ask for directly stated facts, inferential questions challenge students to interpret, analyze, or predict based on textual clues.\\nFor example, \\nExcerpt:\\n\"Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to stress can negatively impact cognitive function, particularly memory and decision-making. This is because chronic stress leads to an overproduction of cortisol, a hormone that, in excessive amounts, has been linked to neural atrophy in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory formation.\"\\nLiteral Question:\\n\"What is one effect of chronic stress on the brain?\"\\n(Answer: Neural atrophy in the hippocampus, affecting memory formation.)\\nInferential Question:\\n\"Why might individuals in high-stress professions experience difficulty making decisions?\"\\n(Reasoning and Answer: The passage states that chronic stress impairs cognitive functions like decision-making. Since high-stress professions expose individuals to prolonged stress, they may experience cognitive difficulties due to excessive cortisol affecting brain regions involved in these functions.)\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Summarize your understanding of what inferential questions are. \\nStep2: Based on the inference, source text, and contextual text, write a question about the inference. \\n  - Focus the question on the inference.\\n  - Use clear and concise language; avoid overly complex or wordy constructions.\\n  - Omit unnecessary introductory phrases such as \"According to the text,\" \"Based on the source,\" or \"According to the passage\\nStep3: Provide a correct answer to the inferential question based on the inference, the source text, and the contextual text. The correct answer should:\\n  - Be indisputably correct based on the text.\\n  - Try not to use words that are in the question.\\n  - Avoid wording that could make multiple answers seem correct.\\nStep4: Provide three plausible distractors based on the text. The distractors should:\\n  - Avoid obviously wrong or ridiculous choices.\\n  - Be plausible and logically parallel but incorrect based on the text. \\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer. \\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid absolute terms (e.g., solely, exclusively, completely, always, never, purely, every, only).\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      Example: \\n      Why is peer review important in academic research?\\n        A) It ensures that every mistake is caught before publication. (Unrealistic exaggeration.)\\n        B) It contributes to the credibility and validity of research. (correct answer)\\n        C) It completely eliminates the risk of bias. (Overly absolute, sounds implausible.)\\n        D) It allows only the best scientists to publish. (Overgeneralized and elitist; not a common misconception.)\\n      Note: The distractors are poor because they do not mirror student thinking—they simply sound extreme or silly, weakening the item\\'s quality.\\n  **Example with good distractors**\\n    What can be inferred about the effects of confirmation bias on how people process new information?\\n      A) People are generally open to changing their beliefs when presented with neutral evidence. (distractor)\\n      B) Confirmation bias can cause people to misinterpret information that contradicts their existing beliefs. (correct answer)\\n      C) The presence of conflicting data usually prompts people to reevaluate their assumptions objectively.

The campaigns to get people out of the sun have gone too far, according to the researcher Johan Moan. â€œThe rays of the sun speed up the bodyâ€™s production of vitamin D. This can prevent cancer as well as many other diseases.â€\\x9d So says Johan Moan, Professor at the Cancer Center at Boston Medical Center. Along with colleagues from Norway, he is presenting results that support the theory that sun exposure provides the body with a more effective defense against cancer. The findings show, for example, that people who live closer to the equator, and whose bodies hence are more exposed to the sun, have a better chance of survival if they develop cancer in their internal organs. Moreover, they show that cancer patients have a better prognosis if they are diagnosed in summer or autumn, when their store of vitamin D has been replenished. Their research has been published in the prestigious scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Sunbathing or cod-liver oil is important to northerners\\nVitamin D has also been shown to play a protective role in many types of cancer of internal organs, and possibly also for a number of other diseases. Avoiding the sun can thus do more harm than good, according to Richard Setlow, who is one of Moanâ€™s collaborators. He thinks that this applies especially to us northerners, who see little of the sun for long periods of the year.

The campaigns to get people out of the sun have gone too far, according to the researcher Johan Moan. â€œThe rays of the sun speed up the bodyâ€™s production of vitamin D. This can prevent cancer as well as many other diseases.â€\\x9d So says Johan Moan, Professor at the Cancer Center at Boston Medical Center. Along with colleagues from Norway, he is presenting results that support the theory that sun exposure provides the body with a more effective defense against cancer. The findings show, for example, that people who live closer to the equator, and whose bodies hence are more exposed to the sun, have a better chance of survival if they develop cancer in their internal organs. Moreover, they show that cancer patients have a better prognosis if they are diagnosed in summer or autumn, when their store of vitamin D has been replenished. Their research has been published in the prestigious scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Sunbathing or cod-liver oil is important to northerners\\nVitamin D has also been shown to play a protective role in many types of cancer of internal organs, and possibly also for a number of other diseases. Avoiding the sun can thus do more harm than good, according to Richard Setlow, who is one of Moanâ€™s collaborators. He thinks that this applies especially to us northerners, who see little of the sun for long periods of the year. Setlow is a biophysicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and is one of the worldâ€™s most recognized experts on the relationship between solar radiation and skin cancer.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the source text:\\n<contextual_text>\\nAdvice encourages less sun exposure, but some sun without sunscreen is beneficial, equating to cod-liver oil Vitamin D levels. Tanning in winter may help counteract Vitamin D deficiency. UVA rays cause melanoma while UVB stimulates Vitamin D; sunscreens should reduce UVA blockage without diminishing beneficial UVB exposure, suggests Setlow.\\n</contextual_text>\",\n",

If you stay outside for half an hour in midsummer, you obtain the same amount of vitamin D as you would from drinking a small bottle of cod-liver oil,â€\\x9d Moan says. He claims that in addition, it would be beneficial to use a tanning bed once or twice a week during the dark winter months, because this provides an excellent supplement of vitamin D at that time of year. â€œFrom November to March we obtain no vitamin D from the sun, and we therefore need to ingest it or obtain it from a tanning bed,â€\\x9d Moan explains. Melanomas are triggered by the type of solar radiation known as UVA. The bodyâ€™s production of vitamin D is stimulated by the type of solar radiation known as UVB.

Good distractors often:\\n  - Reflect common misconceptions or misinterpretations of the text.\\n  - Sound reasonable to a student who only skimmed or misunderstood the text.\\n  - Independent of each other and NOT variants of the correct answer.\\n  - May reflect minor details from the text.\\n  - Be similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity to the correct answer.\\n  - Avoid deterministic words (e.g., solely, exclusively, completely, always, never, purely, every, only).\\n      Many test-takers are trained to spot absolute terms in options as red flags. Using these words in distractors can weaken the item’s ability to discriminate between high- and low-performing students unless they represent a plausible yet incorrect overstatement. Do not use them simply to make distractors sound wrong or extreme.\\n      **Example**: \\n      What is the main idea of the passage?\\n        A). Urban planning always leads to positive outcomes for all residents.(Unrealistic exaggeration)\\n        B). The sole purpose of urban planning is to increase green spaces in cities.(Overgeneralization)  \\n        C). Urban planning must completely eliminate inequality to be effective. (Overly absolute)\\n        D). Urban planning shapes city life and balances livability, equity, and sustainability. (correct answer)\\n      Note: The distractors are easily dismissed by test-wise students, regardless of whether they understood the passage.\\nStep5: Check the length of the correct answer. If the answer is longer than all the distractors, adjust it to be more concise while retaining its meaning.\\nStep6: Arrange the answer options in a logical order whenever possible (from smallest to largest, or from earliest to latest).  If no clear logical order exists, use alphabetical order instead.\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and options to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that all the options are similar in length, structure, tone, and complexity.\\n  - Ensure that all options are ordered logically or alphabetically.\\n\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice main idea question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice main idea question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>What is the main idea of the passage?\\n  \\\\nA) Most companies now require employees to work remotely. \\n  \\\\nB) Remote work has become more common because it benefits companies.\\n  \\\\nC) Remote work is better than working in an office.\\n  \\\\nD) Remote work only benefits employees, not companies.</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags. The answer should contain the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D) and the text of the correct answer. Example:\\n<ANSWER>B) Remote work has become more common because it benefits companies.</ANSWER>\\n',\n",
       "  'user_prompt': \"<text>\\nSun exposure boosts the body's Vitamin D production, enhancing defense against cancer. Johan Moan and colleagues support this theory, noting better cancer survival for those living near the equator. Vitamin D plays a role in protection against various internal cancers. Northerners may risk greater harm by avoiding sun due to limited exposure. Their findings stress sunbathing or cod-liver oil's importance. Richard Setlow, a biophysicist, notes the significance of solar radiation in cancer.  Advice encourages less sun exposure, but some sun without sunscreen is beneficial, equating to cod-liver oil Vitamin D levels. Tanning in winter may help counteract Vitamin D deficiency. UVA rays cause melanoma while UVB stimulates Vitamin D; sunscreens should reduce UVA blockage without diminishing beneficial UVB exposure, suggests Setlow.\\n</text>\",\n",

The campaigns to get people out of the sun have gone too far, according to the researcher Johan Moan. â€œThe rays of the sun speed up the bodyâ€™s production of vitamin D. This can prevent cancer as well as many other diseases.â€\\x9d So says Johan Moan, Professor at the Cancer Center at Boston Medical Center. Along with colleagues from Norway, he is presenting results that support the theory that sun exposure provides the body with a more effective defense against cancer. The findings show, for example, that people who live closer to the equator, and whose bodies hence are more exposed to the sun, have a better chance of survival if they develop cancer in their internal organs. Moreover, they show that cancer patients have a better prognosis if they are diagnosed in summer or autumn, when their store of vitamin D has been replenished. Their research has been published in the prestigious scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Sunbathing or cod-liver oil is important to northerners\\nVitamin D has also been shown to play a protective role in many types of cancer of internal organs, and possibly also for a number of other diseases. Avoiding the sun can thus do more harm than good, according to Richard Setlow, who is one of Moanâ€™s collaborators. He thinks that this applies especially to us northerners, who see little of the sun for long periods of the year. Setlow is a biophysicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and is one of the worldâ€™s most recognized experts on the relationship between solar radiation and skin cancer.   \\n</source_text>\\n\\nHere is the contextual text for the question:\\n<contextual_text>\\nMoan suggests that moderate sun exposure without sunscreen is beneficial and recommends tanning beds in darker months.

Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences can be more than what the user requests. \\n  Skip this step if the user requests none of them. \\n\\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, dates, names, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n  Example (from a psychology textbook):\\n  \"Classical conditioning was first demonstrated by Ivan Pavlov in 1897 through experiments with dogs.\"\\n  Key fact: Ivan Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning in 1897 using dogs.\\n  \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text.

For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Research magazine from Stanford University Journalist Anne Simonson â€“ January 13, 2008 The sun counteracts cancer\\nSunrays that hit our skin reinforce the bodyâ€™s own defense against cancer. The campaigns to get people out of the sun have gone too far, according to the researcher Johan Moan. â€œThe rays of the sun speed up the bodyâ€™s production of vitamin D. This can prevent cancer as well as many other diseases.â€\\x9d So says Johan Moan, Professor at the Cancer Center at Boston Medical Center. Along with colleagues from Norway, he is presenting results that support the theory that sun exposure provides the body with a more effective defense against cancer. The findings show, for example, that people who live closer to the equator, and whose bodies hence are more exposed to the sun, have a better chance of survival if they develop cancer in their internal organs. Moreover, they show that cancer patients have a better prognosis if they are diagnosed in summer or autumn, when their store of vitamin D has been replenished. Their research has been published in the prestigious scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Sunbathing or cod-liver oil is important to northerners\\nVitamin D has also been shown to play a protective role in many types of cancer of internal organs, and possibly also for a number of other diseases. Avoiding the sun can thus do more harm than good, according to Richard Setlow, who is one of Moanâ€™s collaborators. He thinks that this applies especially to us northerners, who see little of the sun for long periods of the year. Setlow is a biophysicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and is one of the worldâ€™s most recognized experts on the relationship between solar radiation and skin cancer.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>â€œPeople are being advised to spend less time in the sun, but some sun without sunscreen is healthy for us. If you stay outside for half an hour in midsummer, you obtain the same amount of vitamin D as you would from drinking a small bottle of cod-liver oil,â€\\x9d Moan says. He claims that in addition, it would be beneficial to use a tanning bed once or twice a week during the dark winter months, because this provides an excellent supplement of vitamin D at that time of year. â€œFrom November to March we obtain no vitamin D from the sun, and we therefore need to ingest it or obtain it from a tanning bed,â€\\x9d Moan explains. Melanomas are triggered by the type of solar radiation known as UVA. The bodyâ€™s production of vitamin D is stimulated by the type of solar radiation known as UVB. Perhaps we should change the sunscreens so that they do not block as much of the UVB radiation, while still protecting us against the UVA rays, according to Setlow.\\n</chunk2>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 1 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 1 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}\n",

The study suggests people living closer to the equator have a higher survival rate from internal organ cancer, and cancer patients diagnosed in summer have better prognoses due to vitamin D. The research emphasizes the protective role of vitamin D against many internal cancers and other diseases, cautioning against avoiding the sun entirely, especially in northern regions with less sun exposure.  Moan advises some sun exposure without sunscreen to boost vitamin D levels, equivalent to a small bottle of cod-liver oil after half an hour in midsummer. He also recommends tanning beds during winter months to supplement vitamin D then, as it’s otherwise unavailable from the sun.
