       "'Energy and trophic levels: Ecological pyramids How can you show how energy is used in an ecosystem? Ecologists use food chains and food webs to model the distribution of matter and energy within an ecosystem. They also use another kind of model, called an ecological pyramid. An ecological pyramid shows how energy flows through an ecosystem. The base of the ecological pyramid represents the autotrophs, or first trophic level. Higher trophic levels are layered on top of one another. The initial source of energy for all ecological pyramids is energy from the sun. Energy decreases at each succeeding trophic level. The total energy transfer from one trophic level to the next is only about ten percent because organisms fail to capture and eat all the food available at the trophic level below them. When an organism consumes food, it uses some of the energy in the food for metabolism, some for building body tissues, and some is given off as waste. When the organism is eaten, the energy that was used to build body tissue is available as energy to be used by the organism that consumed it. The energy lost at each successive trophic level enters the environment as heat. Ecologists construct a pyramid of numbers based on the population sizes of organisms in each trophic level. Sometimes population sizes decrease at each higher trophic level. This is not always true. For example, one tree can be food for 50,000 insects. In this case, the pyramid would be inverted. A pyramid of biomass expresses the weight of living material at each trophic level. Ecologists calculate the biomass at each trophic level by finding the average weight of each species at that trophic level and multiplying by the estimated number of organisms in each population.'"
