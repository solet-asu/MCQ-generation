You excel at identifying and selecting key facts and inferences from these texts for question development.\\n\\n[TASK]:\\n  Your task is to summarize the academic text provided by the user and select the specified number of facts and inferences as requested by the user following the guidelines below. \\n\\n[Guidelines]\\n  Step1: Summarize the text \\n  The text is divided into chunks (as indicated by the html tags such as <chunk1></chunk1>). Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences can be more than what the user requests. \\n  Skip this step if the user requests none of them. \\n\\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, dates, names, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n  Example (from a psychology textbook):\\n  \"Classical conditioning was first demonstrated by Ivan Pavlov in 1897 through experiments with dogs.\"\\n  Key fact: Ivan Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning in 1897 using dogs.\\n  \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Research magazine from Stanford University Journalist Anne Simonson â€“ January 13, 2008 The sun counteracts cancer\\nSunrays that hit our skin reinforce the bodyâ€™s own defense against cancer.

Summarize the content within each chunk, maintaining the chunk tags in your summary.\\n\\n  Step2: Identify key facts and/or inferences\\n  Depending on the user’s requests, create a list of key facts and/or inferences from the academic text. The number of facts or inferences can be more than what the user requests. \\n  Skip this step if the user requests none of them. \\n\\n  Read the definitions below to better understand what key facts and inferences are:\\n  \\n  ** Key Facts**\\n  Key facts are explicit pieces of information stated directly in the text. They usually reflect the main ideas, supporting details, definitions, dates, names, results, or statistics that are important for understanding the author’s argument or findings.\\n  Example (from a psychology textbook):\\n  \"Classical conditioning was first demonstrated by Ivan Pavlov in 1897 through experiments with dogs.\"\\n  Key fact: Ivan Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning in 1897 using dogs.\\n  \\n  ** Key Inferences**\\n  Key inferences are logical conclusions that a reader can draw from the information in the text, even though they are not directly stated. Inferences require the reader to interpret, analyze, or synthesize information to understand implications, underlying meanings, or cause-effect relationships.\\n  Characteristics:\\n  - Require higher-order thinking (interpretive or inferential comprehension)\\n  - Often answer the questions: why, what does this suggest, what can be concluded, what would likely happen if...\\n  Example (from a sociology article):\\n  \"In communities with high income inequality, researchers found lower levels of trust among residents and reduced participation in civic activities.\"\\n  Key inference: High income inequality may contribute to weakened social cohesion.\\n\\n  key inferences may emerge from synthesizing ideas spread across multiple sentences or paragraphs. These inferences require readers to connect concepts that are not directly adjacent in the text.\\n  Example (from a Psychology Text):\\n  chunk1: \"...Studies show that securely attached infants tend to be more socially competent and exhibit fewer behavioral problems later in life...\"\\n  chunk5: \"...Longitudinal research indicates that early childhood experiences with caregivers shape patterns of emotion regulation, social skills, and even academic performance into adolescence and adulthood...\"\\n  Key inference: Children who experience secure attachment and authoritative parenting early in life are more likely to develop strong emotional and social skills that persist into adolescence and adulthood.\\n\\n  Step3: Order the list of facts or/and inferences based on their importance for understanding the text. Select the desired number of facts or/and inferences as requested by the user. \\n  \\n  Step4: Output your response following the JSON format as specified below. \\n\\n  {\\n    \"summary\": \"Summarized text here\",\\n    \"reasoning_for_selection\": \"Your reasoning for the selection here\",\\n    \"selection\": {\\n      \"facts\": {\\n        \"fact1\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"fact2\": {\"content\": \"Content of fact2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more facts as requested by the user\\n      },\\n      \"inferences\": {\\n        \"inference1\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference1\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]},\\n        \"inference2\": {\"content\": \"Content of inference2\", \"chunk\": [chunk_label]}\\n        // Add more inferences as requested by the user\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  - The \"reasoning_for_selection\" should briefly explain how the facts or inferences are derived and why they are important for understanding the text.\\n  - The number of facts and inferences should match the user\\'s request. For example, if the user requests 3 facts, include \"fact1\", \"fact2\", and \"fact3\".\\n  - If no facts or inferences are requested, the values for the \"facts\" or \"inferences\" field should be an empty object {}.\\n  - The \"chunk\" field indicates the source of the facts or inferences in the text. The value is a list of chunk labels obtained from the html tags, such as “chunk1”, “chunk2”. Sometimes an inference may be from multiple chunks, such as [“chunk1”, “chunck2”].\\n\\nStep5: Self-critique your response\\n  After completing the task, review your response to ensure it meets the requirements. Revise your output if necessary. \\n  - Do you keep the chunk tags in the summary? \\n  - Do you provide the number and type of facts and/or inferences as requested by the user?\\n  - Are the facts and/or inferences relevant and essential for comprehending the text? \\n  - Do you provide correct chunk labels to indicate the source of each fact and/or inference?\\n  - Does the output include everything required and follow the format correctly?\\n',\n",
       " 'user_prompt': '<text>\\n<chunk1>Research magazine from Stanford University Journalist Anne Simonson â€“ January 13, 2008 The sun counteracts cancer\\nSunrays that hit our skin reinforce the bodyâ€™s own defense against cancer. The campaigns to get people out of the sun have gone too far, according to the researcher Johan Moan. â€œThe rays of the sun speed up the bodyâ€™s production of vitamin D. This can prevent cancer as well as many other diseases.â€\\x9d So says Johan Moan, Professor at the Cancer Center at Boston Medical Center. Along with colleagues from Norway, he is presenting results that support the theory that sun exposure provides the body with a more effective defense against cancer. The findings show, for example, that people who live closer to the equator, and whose bodies hence are more exposed to the sun, have a better chance of survival if they develop cancer in their internal organs. Moreover, they show that cancer patients have a better prognosis if they are diagnosed in summer or autumn, when their store of vitamin D has been replenished. Their research has been published in the prestigious scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Sunbathing or cod-liver oil is important to northerners\\nVitamin D has also been shown to play a protective role in many types of cancer of internal organs, and possibly also for a number of other diseases. Avoiding the sun can thus do more harm than good, according to Richard Setlow, who is one of Moanâ€™s collaborators. He thinks that this applies especially to us northerners, who see little of the sun for long periods of the year. Setlow is a biophysicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and is one of the worldâ€™s most recognized experts on the relationship between solar radiation and skin cancer.</chunk1>\\n\\n<chunk2>â€œPeople are being advised to spend less time in the sun, but some sun without sunscreen is healthy for us. If you stay outside for half an hour in midsummer, you obtain the same amount of vitamin D as you would from drinking a small bottle of cod-liver oil,â€\\x9d Moan says. He claims that in addition, it would be beneficial to use a tanning bed once or twice a week during the dark winter months, because this provides an excellent supplement of vitamin D at that time of year. â€œFrom November to March we obtain no vitamin D from the sun, and we therefore need to ingest it or obtain it from a tanning bed,â€\\x9d Moan explains. Melanomas are triggered by the type of solar radiation known as UVA. The bodyâ€™s production of vitamin D is stimulated by the type of solar radiation known as UVB. Perhaps we should change the sunscreens so that they do not block as much of the UVB radiation, while still protecting us against the UVA rays, according to Setlow.\\n</chunk2>\\n</text>\\n<number_of_facts>\\nI need 1 key facts from the text.\\n</number_of_facts>\\n<number_of_inferences>\\nI need 1 key inferences from the text.\\n</number_of_inferences>',\n",

You are an expert in writing multiple-choice questions to assess students’ understanding of academic texts (e.g., chapters in textbooks, academic articles).\\n\\n[TASK]:\\nYour task is to write an inferential multiple-choice question (see DEFINITION) based on an inference provided by the user. \\nThis inference will be directly supported by a \"source text\", which is an excerpt from the academic material. \\nA \"contextual text\" will also be provided to help you understand the broader meaning and useage of the source text. \\nFollow the guidelines in [GUIDELINES] to do exactly what you are instructed to do. \\n\\n[DEFINITION]\\n**What are inferential questions?**\\nInferential questions require students to go beyond the explicit information in a text and draw conclusions based on evidence, reasoning, and prior knowledge. Unlike literal questions, which ask for directly stated facts, inferential questions challenge students to interpret, analyze, or predict based on textual clues.\\nFor example, \\nExcerpt:\\n\"Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to stress can negatively impact cognitive function, particularly memory and decision-making. This is because chronic stress leads to an overproduction of cortisol, a hormone that, in excessive amounts, has been linked to neural atrophy in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory formation.\"\\nLiteral Question:\\n\"According to the passage, what is one effect of chronic stress on the brain?\"\\n(Answer: Neural atrophy in the hippocampus, affecting memory formation.)\\nInferential Question:\\n\"Based on the passage, why might individuals in high-stress professions experience difficulty making decisions?\"\\n(Reasoning and Answer: The passage states that chronic stress impairs cognitive functions like decision-making. Since high-stress professions expose individuals to prolonged stress, they may experience cognitive difficulties due to excessive cortisol affecting brain regions involved in these functions.)\\n\\n[GUIDELINES]\\nStep1: Summarize your understanding of what inferential questions are. \\nStep2: Provide a correct answer to the inferential question based on the inference, the source text, and the contextual text. The correct answer should:\\n  - Be indisputably correct based on the text.\\n  - Try not to use words that are in the question.\\n  - Avoid using determinative words such as always, never, absolutely.\\n  - Avoid wording that could make multiple answers seem correct.\\nStep4: Provide three plausible distractors based on the text. The distractors should:\\n  - Be plausible but incorrect based on the text.\\n  - Avoid obviously wrong or ridiculous choices.\\n  - Use common misconceptions or similar-sounding terms.\\n  - Be approximately the same number of words as the answer. \\n  - Be independent of the answer.\\nStep5: Shuffle the answer and distractors to create a list of four options (A, B, C, D).\\nStep6: Self-critique the question and answer choices to ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance. \\n  - Ensure that the question is clear and unambiguous.\\n  - Ensure that the correct answer is clearly the best choice.\\n  - Ensure that the distractors are plausible and relevant.\\n  - Ensure that the answer choices are not too similar or too different in length or complexity.\\n\\nPrint out your reasoning BEFORE you print out the mutliple-choice inferential question. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n1) Wrap up the multiple-choice inferential question within <QUESTION></QUESTION> tags. The stem SHOULD be included in the <QUESTION> tags. Example:\\n<QUESTION>Based on the passage, what is the likely cause of the decrease in energy at each succeeding trophic level in an ecosystem?\\n  \\\\nA) The inefficient capture and consumption of food by organisms\\n  \\\\nB) The availability of sunlight for photosynthesis\\n  \\\\nC) The decrease in the number of autotrophs\\n  \\\\nD) The high metabolic rate of consumers</QUESTION>\\n2) Wrap up the correct answer within <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags.
