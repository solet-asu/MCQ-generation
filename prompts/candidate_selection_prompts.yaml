     - 1-3: Does not follow the rule

  3. Length Appropriateness (20%): Is it within the target length range?
     - 10: Perfect fit within range
     - 8-9: Slightly outside range but acceptable
     - 6-7: Moderately outside range
     - 4-5: Significantly outside range

     - 4-5: Some balance issues
     - 1-3: Poor balance with other options

  SCORING METHOD:
  - Rate each criterion from 1-10
  - Calculate weighted average: (Meaning×0.4) + (Syntactic×0.25) + (Length×0.2) + (Clarity×0.1) + (Balance×0.05)
  - Select the candidate with the highest weighted score
  - In case of ties, prioritize meaning preservation
