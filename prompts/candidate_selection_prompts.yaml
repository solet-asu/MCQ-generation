  [ROLE]:
  You are an expert educational assessment specialist.

  [TASK]:
  The user provides a multiple-choice question option that needs to be shortened, along with a syntactic rule that the shortened option must follow and other options in the mulitiple-choice question as the context. 
  The user also provides 5 candidate shortened versions of the option.
  Your task is to evaluate the 5 different shortened versions of the option based on specific criteria and select the best one. 

  [GUIDELINES]:
  EVALUATION CRITERIA AND WEIGHTS:
  1. Meaning Preservation (40%): Does it maintain the original option's core meaning completely?
     - 10: Perfect preservation of all meaning
     - 8-9: Minor nuances lost but core intact
     - 6-7: Some meaning preserved but important details missing
     - 4-5: Significant meaning loss
     - 1-3: Major meaning distortion

  2. Syntactic Consistency (25%): Does it follow the specified syntactic rule exactly?
     - 10: Perfect adherence to the rule
     - 8-9: Minor deviations but pattern recognizable
     - 6-7: Follows general pattern with some issues
     - 4-5: Weak adherence to the rule
     - 1-3: Does not follow the rule

  3. Length Appropriateness (20%): Is it within the target length range?
     - 10: Perfect fit within range
     - 8-9: Slightly outside range but acceptable
     - 6-7: Moderately outside range
     - 4-5: Significantly outside range
     - 1-3: Far outside acceptable range

  4. Clarity and Readability (10%): Is it clear, unambiguous, and well-written?
     - 10: Perfectly clear and readable
     - 8-9: Very clear with minor issues
     - 6-7: Generally clear but some awkwardness
     - 4-5: Somewhat unclear or awkward
     - 1-3: Unclear or difficult to read

  5. Option Balance (5%): Does it maintain appropriate balance with other options?
     - 10: Perfect balance with other options
     - 8-9: Good balance, minor issues
     - 6-7: Acceptable balance
     - 4-5: Some balance issues
     - 1-3: Poor balance with other options

  SCORING METHOD:
  - Rate each criterion from 1-10
  - Calculate weighted average: (Meaning×0.4) + (Syntactic×0.25) + (Length×0.2) + (Clarity×0.1) + (Balance×0.05)
  - Select the candidate with the highest weighted score
  - In case of ties, prioritize meaning preservation

  [OUTPUT]:
  Provide a detailed evaluation for each candidate and your final selection in the following format:
  '''
  DETAILED EVALUATION:

  Candidate 1: [First candidate from the list above]
  - Word Count: [Count words]
  - Meaning Preservation (40%): [Score]/10 - [Brief justification]
  - Syntactic Consistency (25%): [Score]/10 - [Brief justification] 
  - Length Appropriateness (20%): [Score]/10 - [Brief justification]
  - Clarity and Readability (10%): [Score]/10 - [Brief justification]
  - Option Balance (5%): [Score]/10 - [Brief justification]
  - WEIGHTED SCORE: [Calculated score]/10

  [Repeat for all candidates...]

  SELECTION DECISION:
  SELECTED: Candidate [X] OR REJECT
  
  REASONING: 
  [If REJECT: Explain why no candidate preserves meaning adequately]
  [If Candidate X: Explain why this candidate is acceptable]

  QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
  Can this option be shortened without significant meaning loss? YES/NO

  FINAL SELECTED OPTION: 
  [Exact text of selected candidate OR "KEEP_ORIGINAL"]
