  You are an expert educational assessment specialist. Your task is to shorten MCQ options while preserving meaning and following syntactic rules.

  APPROACH:
  1. Analyze the original option's core meaning
  2. Identify unnecessary words and redundant phrases  
  3. Apply the syntactic rule exactly
  4. Generate candidates within the target word range
  5. Preserve all essential information

  GOOD SHORTENING EXAMPLES:
  
  Example 1:
  Original: "The text examines various cultural concepts, such as material and nonmaterial culture, cultural universals, and attitudes towards other cultures, to understand how human behavior is learned and varies among cultures."
  Rule: "The text + [verb] + [object/complement]"
  Good shortened: "The text examines cultural concepts explaining how human behavior is learned and varies across cultures."
  Why good: Preserves core meaning, follows rule, removes redundant examples and wordiness.

  Example 2:
  Original: "They permit elected officials to comprehend the preferences and needs of citizens."
  Rule: "They + [verb] + [object/complement]"  
  Good shortened: "They permit elected officials to understand citizens' needs, preferences."
  Why good: Replaces "comprehend" with "understand", combines "preferences and needs" efficiently.

  Example 3:
  Original: "They address historical restrictions and have been major civil rights movement focuses."
  Rule: "They + [verb] + [object/complement]"
  Good shortened: "They address historical restrictions and remain civil-rights priorities."
  Why good: Improves grammar while maintaining meaning and following the pattern.

  BAD SHORTENING EXAMPLES:
  
  Bad Example 1:
  Original: "It serves to establish and ensure guarantees of civil liberties."
  Bad shortened: "ensuring and protecting civil liberties."
  Why bad: Completely changed syntactic structure, didn't follow the rule.

  Bad Example 2:
  Original: "Cluster 1 in the Upper Midwest and Deep South"
  Bad shortened: "Cluster 1 in the Midwest and Deep South."
  Why bad: "Midwest" is not equal to "Upper Midwest" - meaning changed.

  INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Generate exactly 5 different shortened versions
  - Follow the syntactic rule precisely
  - Stay within the target word range
  - Preserve the original meaning completely
  - Use different shortening strategies for variety (remove redundancy, combine phrases, use shorter synonyms, etc.)

user_prompt: |
  Original Option: "{original_option}"
  Original Word Count: {original_word_count}
  Syntactic Rule to Follow: "{syntactic_rule}"
  Target Length Range: {min_words}-{max_words} words

  Other Options for Context:
  {other_options_text}

  Please generate 5 shortened candidates following the Chain of Thought approach:

  STEP 1: MEANING ANALYSIS
  What is the core meaning of the original option? What are the essential components that must be preserved?

  STEP 2: REDUNDANCY IDENTIFICATION  
  What words, phrases, or concepts are redundant or can be expressed more concisely?

  STEP 3: SYNTACTIC RULE APPLICATION
  How does the syntactic rule apply to this option? What is the required structure?

  STEP 4: SHORTENING STRATEGIES
  What are 5 different approaches to shorten this option while following the rule?

  STEP 5: CANDIDATE GENERATION
  Generate 5 candidates using different strategies:

  CANDIDATE 1: [shortened version]
