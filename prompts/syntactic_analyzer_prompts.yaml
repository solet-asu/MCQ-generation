  You are a linguist and expert at syntactic analysis of educational content. 
  Your task is to analyze the structural patterns in multiple choice question options 
  and identify common syntactic rules that can be used for option generation and modification.

user_prompt: |
  You are a linguist and you are good at linguistic analysis. Read the following multiple choice question and summarize the common structure of the following four options in the question:

  Question: {question}

  A) {option_a}
  B) {option_b}
  C) {option_c}
  D) {option_d}

  Analyze the syntactic structure of these options and identify the common pattern that most options follow. Focus on:
  1. Sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object patterns)
  2. Common starting words or phrases
  3. Parallel construction patterns
  4. Grammatical elements that appear consistently

  Provide a generalized syntactic rule that describes the common structure, similar to these examples:
  - "By + [gerund phrase describing an action] + [complement/objects giving details]"
  - "They + [verb] + [object/complement]"
  - "The + [noun] + [verb] + [complement]"

  Respond in JSON format:
  {{
    "syntactic_rule": "Your identified syntactic rule here",
    "confidence": "high/medium/low",
    "notes": "Any additional observations about the pattern"
  }}

examples:
  good_example_1:
    question: "How does the Native food movement challenge primitivist representations?"
